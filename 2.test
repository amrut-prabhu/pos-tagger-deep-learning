How can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays ?
I have a kitten who just turned 3 months today .
He 's a good kitty , just when he plays he bites REALLY hard .
Almost every day he 'd even wake me up like 5 am in the morning , trying to bite my arm .
And when I move it I guess he figures I 'm playing . x.x
I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together , and keep it that way til he panics .
That seems cruel to me though .
Any other way ??
Do you think he 's teething ?
It 's getting out of hand .
Yeah , I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong .
No worries , i did n't try .
He does have toys , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
He 'd just randomly walk up to you and start the biting .
When i put him off of my bed , he jumps back on and same thing .
he may be teething but i do nt think it can be stopped .
maybe buy him toys that he can play with that give him a way to use his energy up
yes do not hold any animal s mouth shut it wil close their air way , he s just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys .
lots of them , feather ones work best , also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed , to show him that you will not tolerate that , he will get it , he s also probably teething , so toys are your best bet
Which rat cage is better ?
Hi , I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage .
( Apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover ) Which of these two cages is better :
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_2079wt_893
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/130589513308?var=430034792128&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2648#ht_1500wt_660
I ca nt decide between height or width .
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_
This one is better for rats .
You always want to go higher rather than wider for rats .
They LOVE to climb .
You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said , and make fleece covers for the stairs , so no ratty feet get caught and broken .
This cage will hold about 2 - 3 rats .
Both are equal length so go for the taller one .
If you use this cage it 's best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like .
I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it was n't that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door springs are annoying and it does n't last very well .
Here are some better options IMO :

http://www.justcages.co.uk/ferret-cages/ferplast-furet-plus-ferret-cage#v_431
These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand ... better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO .
The First One Is much Better !
I Have This Exact Cage , Bought From The Exact Ebay User .
It s Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake ?
i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side .
i m not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
from my understanding , if it s heated from the bottom , my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate , but it has better heat distribution
if it s from the side i do nt have to worry about propping it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it does nt distribute heat as well ?
what are your suggestions and opinons ?
i use UTH's on all of my burrowing snakes .
they will move if they get too warm - it 's not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs .
i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine .
i have over 40 corns , kings , and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system .
on the side is a waste - leave it on the bottom .
good luck !
Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper ...
I now use a 75 watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner

Question about the sinking of the Titanic ?
After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking ?
If yes , was Canada involved in this act / law ?
Sorry , I 'm just very nervous after watching the movie .
SOLAS ( Safety Of Life At Sea ) , which is an international maritime treaty , came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic .
Today , it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships , regardless of country of registration .
If you ever go on a cruise ship , you will be required to attend a SOLAS muster drill ( lifeboat drill ) within 24 hours of sailing .
Most ships perform this drill before even leaving the dock .
SOLAS covers just about every aspect of safety at sea , including minimum safety equipment , practices , and standards , lifeboats , navigation practices , fire protection , and so on .
We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS , and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy , the adoption of SOLAS is probably it .
http://www.caribbean-cruising.net
--------------------------------------------------
Edit : Also I forgot to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly , and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port .
This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed , but makes the crew proficient at launching them .
I do n't think so
Do n't worry .
When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking ?
100 years ago ?
What are some fun things I could do while in Japan ?
I 'll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do ?
I 'm a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything .
Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for .
How is the night life in Naha ?
Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands , or just a venue at all ?
It does n't have to be underground it could be any type of music .
Thanks
The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach .
Otherwise , you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan , like shopping , eating , etc .
Or you can visit temples or shrines in Okinawa .
Well first you can try speaking Japanese .
Go to a sumo tournament .
Eat at a conveyor - belt sushi restaurant .
Climb Mount Fuji .
Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan , although of course there are similarities .
The main thing people do there is go to the beach .
There 's the market in Naha , which is great .
You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious , fresh sashimi / sushi lunch upstairs .
Try the local sake too if you can .
It 's a special kind .
I 'm not sure that there 's much nightlife in Naha .
It 's more of a place to go to enjoy the weather , the sea , etc .
You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya ( pub ) somewhere .
Your best bet would probably be to get a copy of the Lonely Planet Japan book and read the chapter on Okinawa .
Naha 's not a very big city .
Modern m 16 vs Vietnam m 16 version ?
I was playing a video game that has a m 16 Vietnam model , and in the game it 's 3 - shot burst .
My brother said they only had full - auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam .
My questions are ..
1 ) what the s difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m 16 ?
2 ) did Vietnam m 16's have a 3 - shot burst function ?
To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M - 16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older ( dirtier ) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M - 14 .
He also ordered that the receiver not get a ( I think chrome ) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming .
Than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self - cleaning , which it was n't .
As a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming .
Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era M - 16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for .
The screw - up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean - counters ( and McNamara was nothing if not a bean - counter ) instead of soldiers in charge of the military .
Today 's weapons do not have that kind of problem , and are much more reliable .
1 ) modern m 16 is alright .
Vietnam m 16 used to clog up and never work .
2 ) All M 16's are either automatic or semi automatic .
No one uses 3 burst .
you play too much cod ;P
modern m 16 is best
Planning on going to New Zealand in January .
Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
Are the hotels back up and running ?
Are there still aftershocks ?
Planning on going to North and South Island .
Is it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?
Rotorua is fine .
I 'm assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake , do n't worry , it was very deep , so nothing was effected :)
As for Christchurch , yes the aftershocks are still happening , but these are fairly small - you can feel them , but the do n't do any damage .
Since lots of people are still living there , then it must be fine to visit .
However the CBD is closed of to the public as a lot of it is still rubble and stuff and has n't been cleared away yet .
I 'm sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be some in close by towns .
Despite the aftershocks I would recommend going to Christchurch , just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes .
Have fun in New Zealand !!
( ps. I 'm assuming you 'll stop off in Wellington , and since it s summer , may I recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos ?
Just recently discovered them last time I was down there , they 're very nice ) www.kaffeeeis.co.nz
Loads of places have geographical hazards , if you are constantly paranoid , you 'll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure .
In case of an earthquake , stay under a sturdy table and do n't go outside as possible debris will fall .
Yes it 's ok .
Yes , yes and yes .
Nothing wrong with rotorua
Help ?!
What size horse do i need ?
I m around 5 ' 2 - 5 ' 4 , 11 years old and i m wondering what size horse i 'll need that i wo nt grow out of quickly ?
thanks
louise
I would say it really depends on your riding ability , what disciplines you are interested in doing , or plan on doing , etc .
But I would go for the base number of 15 hh .
It 's " tall " being it 's bigger than a pony , but it 's on the small end for a horse .
I got my horse when I was 12 and I was already 5 ' 9 - 5 ' 10 , thankfully I stopped growing when I hit 5 ' 11 " but my horse is about 16.2 or 16.3 hh , TB .
So do n't be afraid to get something a little bigger than " perfect " just in case you hit a growth spurt .
A taller horse does n't always mean a horse you ca n't handle .
Keep that in mind .
Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground , if you even need to , etc .
You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is , you can handle it .
i 'm 5 ' 3 - 4 " and am 21 well will be in Nov and my horse is 14.2 hh and she 's perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha i ca n't bareback , not yet
If you Do n't want to grow out of it quickly get a 14 ' 2 ..
Anything smaller you will grow out , anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage , especially when riding .
Hope I helped :)
Where in the world is Iguazu ?
Iguazu Falls
Widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world , the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil , are a certainly must see attraction in the area .
The centre of the falls is known locally as ??? Garganta Del Diablo ??? ( The Devil ???s Throat ) , where the huge volume of water sends a constant mist of spray into the air .
With the sun shinning down on the spray , creating a rainbow in the foreground , this is the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls photograph .
However , save some of your shots for the rest of the falls , as in total there are around 270 cascades that spread out over nearly 2 miles of the Iguazu River .
The Iguazu Falls are easily accessible and , dependent on your time restrictions and budget , you can get to the area by either bus or plane .
The nearest towns to the site are Puerto Iguazu in Argentina , about 12 miles from the falls , and Foz do Igua??u in Brazil , which is equally close .
Both towns have airports that are served regularly from the larger cities such as Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires .
The bus is obviously the cheaper option , and travelling up from Buenos Aires the trip is a full 20 hours , although the buses are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats .
The bus trip down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours .
Foz on the Brazilian side is the larger town , however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks , and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets .
For those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget , there are some hotel complexes much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls .
Paris or England while studying aboard ?
I am going to try and study aboard but idk where I can go I can not decide where do you think would be the best place to go ?
where would you go ?
I have never been anywhere out side my home town Charlotte north Carolina please help !!!!
definitely London -
you speak the language and will have more fun .
The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad .
London is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around .
You will be able to have a good time there .
%
As you 're from the States you 'll have much more fun in London .
Parisians dislike Americans for their lack of speaking French and proper French manners .
I was told to leave a restaurant because I ordered water with my meal ( apparently this is " washing down " your food " ) and not ordering wine .
You 'll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris .
However , outside Paris everybody is wonderful .
Nobody likes the Parisians , even then Parisians do n't like Parisians .
South France is wonderful , right on the Mediterranean .
It 's beautiful and the people are extremely friendly .
I used to live in London for 6 months and it 's by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ( I 've been to 45 countries in 5 years ) .
Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly .
However , if you 're allowed another option and you want a small - town feel , then head to Edinburgh , Scotland .
I lived there for 8 months .
If your French is good / moderate , then head to Paris without a doubt .
I also highly recommend staying with a French family .
I did this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing .
does the bta have to be paid first to come to canada ?
There is NO such thing as a BTA .
That is a term invented by online romance scammers

" Second only to flight money , the Basic Travel Allowance ( BTA ) is the scammer s highest paying income .

Please remember : there is NO such thing .
There is NO such requirement , in any country of the world .

A single call to CIC will confirm there is NO such thing as a BTA to Canada and anyone asking for this is a scammer http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/contacts/index.asp
Just pray that you have not ever given this criminal enough information for your identity to be stolen - your full name , birthdate , home address , etc or that you were not conned into sending money .
This person is not coming to visit you - the whole point of this scam is to gain your trust enough to steal your money and identity
Contact the Anti-Fraud Centre to report this http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/english/home-eng.html
No .
BTA only exists in the mind of SCAMMERS .
100 % SCAM .
cut of all contact and tighten up your PC security .
There is no such thing as a BTA or " Basic Travel Allowance " - this is 100 % a scam - as the first poster said , cut off any and all contact with this person - they are NOT who or what they are claiming to be .

How can i make my Jack Dempsey reproduce ?
i have a Mature male and female they are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as i know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
He 's the issue , you are trying to " Make " them mate .
This is like trying to Make 2 people get married .
It does n't work .
First you need a compatible pair .
Sounds like your 2 at least tolerate each other , so there is hope there .
Then the need to be mature , that is , old enough , and big enough to breed .
This may be around 1 / 2 of their full adult size , probably 4 - 5 " for those guys .
Then the environment .
Large tank , no annoying tankmates , perfect water conditons and really good feeding .
The difference is what they need to live , VS what 's ideal for them .
Get that right , and they will mate when THEY are ready .
You ca n't MAKE them mate , you can only encourage them .
Ian
Jack Dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed .
Most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other .
Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3 - 5 days .
The tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish , or a few of them , but at least 1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in .
The p H should be 6.5 - 7 .
Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms , blackworms and / or earthworms as it can eat for 3 - 5 days .
Then add the other mate .
They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked .
When the male s aggressive behavior stops , it is ready to spawn .
The two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them .
Turn the water temp up to 82 degrees
Please help with my cat s bladder issue ?
I have a 1 1 / 2 year old female calico .
When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney .
Recently she has been peeing A LOT .
I 'm talking soaking all the litter box and then some .
She is also peeing around the box and somehow it gets underneath .
I do n't have the money to take her to a vet right now but it 's getting to be an issue .
I have to scrub the floor 2 - 3 times a week now .
What could be the issue and can I try some home remedies first ?
I love her and want to help her but I do n't know when I 'll be able to take her to to vet :( please help .
First of all , I am very sorry to hear you 're having this issue with your cat . :(
Frequent urination is a sign of several things .
Bladder or Urinary tract infections are two common ones , but these usually are frequent visits , with small amounts of urine being passed .
If there is blood in the urine , or the cat seems to be in pain , then that is also a good indicator .
But your cat is passing a LOT of urine , and this is bad .
Given the chance your cat may only have one kidney , I would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease , which untreated can lead to possible renal failure .
Signs of this can be hard to spot , and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet .
Vomiting , bad breath , and listlessness .
Seizures will occur when the toxins that the kidney normally filters out are released into the blood stream .
I know you are very worried , but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her .
In the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her .
I want to apply for canada skilled immigeration program .
I got only 63 points while 67 minimunm is requirement .?
Can i apply with 63 points ?
According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada web site at http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/assess/index.asp , it states " Note : you must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing . "
HOWEVER ... that same web page also states that " The current pass mark is 67 .
The pass mark could change .
You should check for updated information on a regular basis . "
The Skilled Worker category was my first attempt at permanent residency .
And between the time I began my research and the time I applied , the minimum score did change once .
Unfortunately , both minimums were above my score .
But I got lucky because I qualified under another category to become a permanent resident .
So keep checking at least on a weekly basis .
GOOD NEWS ... I found a web page run by Canadian Immigration Lawyers at http://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-immigration-faq-skilled-workers.html .
Here is what they posted there
" 4 . May I qualify under the Skilled Worker category even if I score less than 67 points ? "
" If the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect your ability to become economically established in Canada , the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer may use his or her positive discretion ( referred to as substituted evaluation ) and approve your application even though you score less than 67 points . "
Read the full answer at that web page for conditions .
Sure you can apply .
The points system acts as a guide to sort out the best candidates .
Your application is still evaluated on a number of criteria , not all of them as " cast in steel " as the points .
Go ahead , send in your application .
NOTE to BEN .
67 is the minimum score , anything below that is filed in the " circular file basket " .
Why have a " minimum " if it is going to be ignored ?

I 'm mad and do n't know what to do !
Please help !?
Alright , so my dad had been wanting me to check my e mail for a few days but I never got around to it .
( I just thought he wanted me to see one of those chain letter things again ) so I fineally checked it , and it was an e mail from southwest airlines telling me the flight dates for out family trip to Florida !!!
I got so excited !!!!
It said it was in January but still !!!!
So I kept reading and then I saw the dates , it was from mid day Friday and arriving home mid day monday . :(
then I think I just kind of stopped smiling and just kind of sat there looking at the dates .
( we live in Pennsylvania btw ) I 'm mad and upset now !
Do n't get me wrong I want to go , but for 2 days -_- I mean seriously .
We are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in Florida and staying only 2 days .
**** sigh **** not trying to sound snooty or stuck up but I mean really !
Can someone please make me feel better about this trip !!!!
A least you r going .!
Enjoy those 2 days it better then not going at all .!
and it will be fun 2 days cause you will busy going to a lot of beautiful places , i can afford to go so be happy you have the money to go . :D
Well , I mean , you do n't have to be mad about it .
At least you get to go to Florida in JANUARY .
And , having only two days makes you realize what you have with your family .
" Nothing Gold Can Stay " , honey .
Enjoy it while you can , and then if your family enjoys it you can go again for a longer period of time .
If they do n't like it , it 'll only be two days , remember ?
Hope you have a crapload of fun !

What is Italian High Renaissance ?
Have a look at this , it may help .
1 ) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe .
The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt .
Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .
The word renaissance ( Rinascimento in Italian ) means ??? rebirth ??? , and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages .
These changes , while significant , were concentrated in the elite , and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages .
2 ) The expression High Renaissance , in art history , is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance .
The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardo s fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V .
This term was first used in German ( Hochrenaissance ) in the early nineteenth century , and has its origins in the " High Style " of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann .
[ 1 ] Over the last twenty years , use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for over-simplifying artistic developments , ignoring historical context , and focusing only on a few iconic works .

I 'm American and I am going to the UK for the first time , what should I expect ?
I just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the UK before so that I know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything .
do you get your visitor s visa immediately at the airport ?
I was told that americans automatically get a six months visitor s visa .
do you have to go through a medical exam right away ?
drug test ?
blood test ?
or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates ?
i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say it s a routine thing when entering another country .
I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute - which I really do n't have the money for .
I 'm really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly .
An American passport should get you right into the country , there is no need for a VISA , for six months .
There is no medical exam or blood test or others like that .
You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice .
http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1052.html
Above is the link to the Department of State travel website , which will give you all the info that you need , including passport information .
It is free .
I never stayed more than two weeks at a time when I visited the U.K .
You should be fine with just a passport , unless you 're staying longer than six months .
You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though .
I am not sure how well you planned this trip .
You 'll have a great time , so no worries there .
I visited London , Edinburgh , and St. Andrew s so far , and I was treated very well and with great kindness .
Just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated , and you 'll be fine .
That tactic never failed me .

i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ?
if you had any pics of your hens i would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks ?
A Sussex crossed with Silkie would make a crossbred * mutt * chicken .
There are a lot of genetics at play between a Sussex and Silkie , so the offspring would vary in appearance .
You do n't say what color Silkie or Sussex you are dealing with so I ca n't say what color your chicks would be likely to be .
However , I can say what features they would / could have .
Feather Type .
Silkies have hookless feathers .
Sussexs have soft feathers .
All offspring from this cross will have soft feathers , as hookless feathers are a recessive gene .
Skin Color : Silkies have black skin color , which is dominate .
Sussex have White Skin which could be recessive or dominate .
Either way rec. and dom. white genes dilute the black gene .
Skin will be darker but lighter then the Silkies .
Beards / Muffs : If your Silkie has a beard / muff the offspring could have a beard as well , as these genes are incomplete dominate .
Feathered Feet / Shanks - Chicks could have feathered feet / shanks as this is also incomplete dominate .
Crest : Chicks could also develop a small crest due to this being another incomplete dominate gene .
Comb Type : Silkies have walnut combs which is actually genetically two comb types ( Rose and Pea ) single is also there , but is recessive .
So crossed to a Sussex you could get a walnut , pea , rose , or single combed bird .
Five Toes : Silkies have five toes .
Sussex have four toes .
Crossed together ( five toes is incompletely dominate ) chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both , or even one foot .
Silkie crosses are great birds , and very neat looking .
Hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger , can see better , and are smarter the Silkies .
Best wishes ,

I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 .
What do you think of these photos ?
http://i.imgur.com/S2MD2.jpg http://i.imgur.com/T2zff.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Xytex.jpg I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 ( see links above ) .
What do you think of these photos ?
The lighting was not the best , but the pics turned out ok in my opinion .
deleting a question where you do nt like the answer wo n't get you better answers ... i refer to my previous answer :
you need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on using the camera properly ...
[ edit - and she most be very new to modeling , because she does look unsure of her poses )
lol , he has posted this so many times today already .
clearly he s mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it 's NOT his gf
Not bad , but too many distracting elements for my taste .
For example :
In the photo on the couch , the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot .
There are also some distracting background elements like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left .
In the standing photo ( from the front ) there is a corner of a rug creeping in , some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord .
In the shot from the back , the crumpled bottom of the curtain is pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet .
Compositionally , this one is not my favorite , I would suggest trying a different crop because I do nt think cutting her off at the calf looks great .
I do like the shadow , though .
My suggestion is to pay close attention to what 's going on in the background and if possible , stand on a chair , get on the ground , do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements .
Using a fairly wide aperture is also helpful in blurring out unwanted background elements .
I 've had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background I did n't notice at first .
what are some unique customs in ireland ?
As far ask I ???m aware our most unique custom would be the ??? Country Wake ??? .
In all my travels I ???ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners .
After a person dies , their remains are ??? waked ??? in their home for roughly 2 - 3 days .
In this time visitors will come to the house , pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun .
The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains .
Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .
But only really in the countryside .
The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral , this tradition started after the civil war .
Another unique custom ( and a dying one at that ) is the Pioneers .
The Pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance ( abstaining from alcohol ) , in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that Ireland was gripped by .
Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee - total and at the hight of the organization popularity , had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary .
I my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
The Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argued by some not to be an Irish custom but unarguable ticks every criteria to be considered one .
The marches on the 12th of July are only really attended by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of the are the largest attended paraded in Ireland .
Barn brack and the ring .
the irish customs we have in our family are ; we make sinnel cake for easter , barn brack and col - cannon for Halloween .
christmas cake for christmas day .
Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
I 'm unsure of this , because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she did n't react to seeing another cat on TV .
I heard that a company ( here is a link : http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs , complete with squeaky chew - toy sounds , and high pitched sounds that humans ca n't hear .
As far as I understand , this ad will get dogs excited , but my question is : Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans ?
Also , can animals remember images on TV like us , humans ?
If so , then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog / cat / parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared ?
I would n't know -- I do n't particularly like scary movies , and I have n't tried this with my pet .
Although , I do n't think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time ; I am sure they 'll forget sometime -- or am I wrong ?
So what about T.V. ?
Do dogs enjoy watching T.V. ?
Well , T.V. is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture .
The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60 Hz , which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving , flawless picture .
To a dog , watching T.V. is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80 Hz .
So they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them .
So chances are that if your dog likes to watch T.V. , it ???s probably because of the sounds .
Hearing is a dog ???s secondary sense , and I will discuss that in another blog entery .
Yes they do .
i m pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
How much should I be looking at for horse transportation ?
I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season , and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live .
The place where I 'm boarding is not likely to want to take me this far , and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself .
So I want to hire someone ( or multiple people ) to transport me to these shows .
If they ask how much I 'm willing to pay , what is a good price range ?
I saw a site that charges $ 0.70 per mile .
Is that reasonable ?
Impossible to say , but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that , and some on top for the driver 's time and effort , unless you are able to share transport with another or more , that would keep the costs down .
Remember that you get what you pay for .
Three hours is n't far , but you are doing multiple shows .
Some people are willing to take your horse , but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world .
Rusted , torn corners in the stalls , unhealthy air , straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard , if not downright dangerous , on your horse .
I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big , open stock trailer .
He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight .
Since then , I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him , stop every few hours for water , and their trailers all have super smooth suspension .
All horses I 've had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive .
I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote .
Even though you may not want to use them , it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair .
See link below .
Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded / insured and knows something about first aid .
Do they have this anywhere ?
I want to take a cruise around the world .
I mean literally around the world if possible .
First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess .
Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wan na go to ?
Like you can pick the destinations ?
But if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere .
1 . Here 's a site that lists world cruises including prices .
http://www.cruisecompete.com/specials/regions/world/1
Prices listed , however , are usually based on two people in a cabin , and you will likely face some high " single supplement " costs in addition .
( Two people in a cabin will spend more onboard , so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone .
You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete ) .
2 . Short of chartering your own ship and crew , I do n't see any way you could customize your own itinerary .
Good luck !
Various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines , typically 100 days in duration .
Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy .
No possibility to customise ports of call .
Prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise lines sell segments all along the way i.e Transatlantic to London ( England ) , England to Barcelona ( Spain ) , Barcelona to Alexandria ( Egypt ) , Egypt to India via Suez canal etc .
yes there are multiple around the world cruises , mainly offered by the more upscale lines .
HOWEVER : you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin , even if it is just you .
so any price you find , DOUBLE IT figure , $ 40 K at least .
and no you can not customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing .
Was the San Francisco Bay Area mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s ?
No .
There has been a large Asian presence in the SF Bay Area for a long time -- the Chinatown here was the largest population of chinese outside of China , there were lots of Japanese who 'd been displaced during WWII .
The whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight was black .
The Mission was basically latin - american .
As the southeast asians and philipinos came over , they added to the cultures .
So , the Bay Area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time -- caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that 's because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that 's who the photographers took pictures of .
The other ethicities were n't well represented in politics yet -- or rather , they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70's due largely to the more open - minded hippy generation .
Marin County was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs .
It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact .
You never saw black MUNI drivers , Asian police , Latino politicians until then .
It was an evolution .
Many illegals were not counted in the population until the mid-80s .
We did not have big percent of Chinese migration until the mid 90s .
We had fewer people running across the Mexican border then .
We had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted .
Only Caucasians had any political power , corporate presence or owned businesses except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods .
San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers who were manual laborers .
There has always been a Mexican - American cultural influence since Calif was owned by Mexico .
We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected .
San Francisco was always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kinds of people historically .
The counties outside San Francisco were more white than San Francisco in the 70s .
EDIT : My memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time .
Can rabbits and chickens live together ?
I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet , but my parents said that it has to stay outside .
We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage / barn thing .
There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens , but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night .
However , in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens ?
We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but it 's nothing that a rabbit would n't be able to digest just fine .
So , can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water ?
( The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit , the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed ?
My last rabbit did that a few times , and he was fine ...
I just wan na make sure :) Thank !
Yes , but be sure that your chickens are all hens ( I mean not roosters ) , Roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving , so be aware of that , hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets !
From my experience Hens ( Not roosters ) are very friendly with duck , Guinea pigs , kittens , cows , Rabbits , etc .
Be sure not to feed your rabbits non-veg items !
You said they live in different cages and they are free in day , so no problem , do n't put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens , wet bedding can cause diseases in them !
So , do n't put both of them in one cage .
Good luck !
yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender .
So be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens .
Rabbits do burrow also so do n't be surprised if chicken are falling into holes .
rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that .
melting brass did not work ?
my friends and I are trying to melt bras to make some little figures .
we have made a furnace as such , we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , filled the pipe with brass scrap , surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot , everything got red hot but did not melt .
what am I doing wrong
I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
I 'll just echo both other answers .
Molten brass is damn hot and usually it 's pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen .
Even if you did melt it , I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it .
It 's really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
Just the zinc fumes will get you , if you do n't take precautions .
Pewter is perfect for what you are doing , and it melts on a stove top .
I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just does n't get hot enough .
I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal ( e.g. for blacksmithing one needs coal , not barbecue charcoal ) .
I have done a fair amount of metal casting , but never tried to build my own furnace , but I think your version is just too small and does n't get hot enough .
I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumbers torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill ) .
I melt brass and cast it http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
Brass melts at just under 2000 F which is a bright yellow heat , not red hot .
http://www.mikegigi.com/techspec.htm#SELCTEMP
You might be able to make a version of your setup work , but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air .
I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm and http://www.mikegigi.com/firehole.htm
Should all UK towns and their cafes or restaurants provide Halal food ?
Some friends of mine visited Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer .
They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods .
It s important to their religion that they only consume Halal food .
Even if you buy a cake in a baker s you can not be too what happens in the kitchen , for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham .
It s simply not just a case of avoiding pork , alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods .
Places like Dartmouth are supposed to be tourist towns and should provide foods for people of all religions .
We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday .
Not everyone wants to bring packed lunch .
It s not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them .
I think it s only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal .
When I went to Bosnia , all the meat was Halal .
I will not eat halal meat , so guess what , I opted for foods which were n't a meat dish , there were plenty of other options .
I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it .
When you go to another country , you live by their way of life and their laws , if you do n't like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away , huh ) .
Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway , they normally have blue for bakery items have red for cooked meat have brown for raw meat , etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies .
No .
To prevent animal cruelty , many countries forbid Halal and Kosher meat .
Switzerland is one , and the Netherlands are passing the same law .
It will become EU law in a couple of years .
We ca n't dictate what business wants to open where .
If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places .
How to convince my parents to let me get a Ball python ?
They do n't know ANYTHING about Ball pythons .
When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house .
She has no experience with snakes and has never held one .
I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one , I 'm 14 by the way
Lay some knowledge on them dude .
Maybe if they see how much time and effort you 've devoted to researching the animal they 'll reconsider .
Tell them it costs like 8 dollars a month ( if even that much ) to keep it fed .
Be helpful around the house to show that even if you ca n't pay for it yourself that you re willing to work for it .
Once you 've buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be .
Maybe even try to get your mom to hold it a bit .
My wife was TERRIFIED of snakes when we first met , I introduced her to one out my baby corn snakes and she fell in love with it .
Be persistent , but do n't pester them about it cause that 'll get you nowhere fast .
Good luck !
My general convince your parents to let you get a reptile advice :
1 . Be responsible .
Do all your chores without being nagged , take care of any existing pets , keep your room clean , and so on .
Prove , to your parents ' satisfaction , that you , not they , will be the one actually taking care of your new pet .
2 . Save up , and research , so that you are ready for your new pet .
3 . Bargain with them .
Offer to do extra chores , ask for your pet as a reward for good grades , something like that .
4 . Play the sympathy card .
If you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend needs to get rid of because they 're moving or whatever , you might be able to talk your parents into " giving it a good home " where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet .
On the fear angle -- talk her into coming to the pet store with you .
Once you 're there , ask if you can hold a ball python .
Once you 're holding it , try to get her to touch / pet it ...
My Snake 's meal is TOO big , what can I do ?
Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ) .
Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily .
But today , I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE !
I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold - blooded creature .
So my true question comes to this , how can I knock the rat out ?
If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull ?
I really do need answers and advice , and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS !!
LIKE SERIOUSLY !! >:(
Best answer shall receive points :)
iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once , snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give her a good hunt , but if you do want him knock him i d just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i do nt know , i agree with you though throw him , haha
Ok so if youre snake will take pre-killed , you can " gas it " .
Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it .
If it wo n't take pre-killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
I do n't like that option though - I think it 's pretty cruel and I'd not done properly you 'll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake .
I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane .
You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey .
Good luck !
Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your snake on frozen / thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run .
My opinion - take it for what it 's worth ??? :-)
Looking to move to Toronto ?
I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area .
Im moving from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock .
Any suggestions ?
Being gay and living in Toronto is just fine .
You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street , right downtown .
It is full of gay friendly " everything " .
But , you could live where ever you fancy takes you .
For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
But , can you immigrate ?
Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada .
Start your process here , if you have n't already .
( Marrying a Canadian is not enough - that does n't count for at least two years . )
http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp
A normal processing time , unless you have an advanced degree or a " specified " skill is from 3 - 5 years .
Coming to stay , and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD .
Let s be clear about this ...........
Just ' wanting to come to Canada " is NOT enough .
You MUST apply , to become a Immigrant , and WAIT to be approved , by the Canadian Government .
YOUR education ( the more the better ) and your past work history , combined with a CLEAN FBI and State Police record , and a satisfactory financial history ( no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the USA ) are all taken into consideration .
It is a competition , and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others , from all over the world , for a place in the line up .
IF you have NOT begun the Application process's NOW < you are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by Immigration Canada .
So do n't pack your bags , yet .
Whatever you do ............... DO NOT try to come here with out legal permission .
You will not be able to seek work or take a job , in Canada , with out having to show your Immigration VISA and Canadian Social Insurance Number card to any potential employer .
Being an American and from the " south " you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud .
Do it properly , and legally , and you will be OK .

How to train my puppy ?
I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy .
Recently I 'm having trouble training him .
He is kind of hate walking with leash , every time I put the leash on , he will try to bite it .
And he is not following me when I was walking .
I saw lots of videos about this , but actually it did n't help .
Is there any way can let him know how to walk with leash ?
And every time he see some one he will rush to people and jump on them , does n't listen to me .
He is really excited about anybody he see .
How to prevent this ?
Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him , he will try to jump on , if he ca n't , he will bark all the time until I let him get on , what should I do with this ?
Anyone have any suggestion ?
thank you very much .
Hi , I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs .
You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness .
This type of harness goes around the dog s chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades .
This way , he can not reach the leash to chew it .
When he swivels his head to go for it anyway , tell him sharp " UH UH " gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk .
Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash .
Patience is the key here .
He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
And always , always train with love and positive methods - never hit or harshly scold .
Never train out of fear .
You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader , not fear you .
Good luck with your puppy !
All the best .
Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer . :)
why do nt you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right .
or , as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv , get a clicker type thing and treats as well .
try to train him to heel , which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash , and he may do that .
or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably , if you act quick enough , will stay on the leash .
What sort of Hotel could I expect to find in New Delhi / Agra / Varanasi for rs 500 per night ?
Hey guys .
I 'm looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night .
There would be four of us so we would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs 1000 , close to the centre of these cities .
This would be on a walk - in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good ( Not relying on pictures from the internet ) and is in a spot we like .
Thanks in advance for sharing your experience !
Sorry , almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk - in to these hotels rather than pre book ?
In Delhi I 'd recommend Ajay Guesthouse .
Travelled to Delhi twice and stayed there twice .
Rooms start from 500 per double .
Those ones are quite small .
Must say , in Delhi it 's hard to get good price / quality rating .
I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide .
It 's in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice .
But in general , Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price .
In Varanasi I do n't know .
I 've stayed in a more expensive hotel there , but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor ?
Also , while travelling ask people where they 've been and if they have any hotel recommendations .
In Agra I 've stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended , they found it in the Rough Guide .
It was nice and close to the Taj .
It was quite easy to find something .
( Do nt stay in Agra too long .
One night is enough ! )
There were many hotels there .
I ve paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean .
Good luck , enjoy your time !
You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned , the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra .
http://www.goldentriangleindia.com/delhi/hotels-in-delhi.html
To Stay in delhi - Hotel Aster Inn is best to stay in delhi .
it is in karol bagh .
some beautiful locations like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market , Presidential Palace , and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar are near to it .
TO Stay in Agra - Hotel Atithi and Aditya Palace is perfect for you .
it is centrally situated .
To Stay in Varanasi - Sandeep Hotel is you choice ...
which one out of these makes the best pet ?
a degu , a rat , a mouse , a hamster or a guinea pig ?
and why is the one a better pet ?
Get a guinea pig .
I have a hamster , and mice and rats like to escape .
The Guinea pig is better because it s a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .
So if you lose him , he is easier to find , because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages .
So my opinion is Guinea pigs .
( plus they do nt stink that bad )
Depends on what you want in a pet , to be honest .
Also depends on the space you have , how much time you can handle the pet , how much money you can spend , etc .
I 've had experience with all of those pets except Degus .
My favorite would have to be the rat .
They 're incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean .
Mine learned to " go to the bathroom " only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch .
The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat .
That means expense , space , and they require weekly cage cleaning .
My second favorite would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats ( at least mine was n't ) but more so than most hamsters or mice .
Again , pairs or trios and pretty big living space .
They , too , need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit .
I could handle my mice , but they where skittish and preferred their cage .
I 've never met a hamster that did n't bite me .
Never had / handled a Degu .
Get a guinea pig .
We have two .
They are social and like to be handled .
You have to have two because they do n't do well alone .
Make certain you get two females .
Two males can fight and you definitely do n't want babies !!
Guinea pigs ( also called cavies ) are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night .
They will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce .
They love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos , celery , cucumbers , carrots .
Do n't feed them broccoli , cauliflower , garlic , onions , head lettuce .... they are all too difficult for them to digest .
Also they ca n't eat potatos , they are toxic for them .
If you keep the cage clean they do n't smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them , just massage it into their coat and groom them .
Fostering 6 week old kittens and HATING IT !
Need Advice !?
I wanted to volunteer and help animals , and decided to try fostering kittens .
This is my first experience and I have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wit s end .
I do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment .
They track poop everywhere ( most disgustingly my bed .... ) , and am constantly trying to climb up everything , including my bare legs !
My legs and hands are just full of scratches .
I realize they are young and that cats do climb , but this is just ridiculous .
My apartment also smells repulsive even though I am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice .
Any suggestions and helpful hints to make this a more positive experience would be extremely appreciated .
That 's kind of the way it goes .. lol .
Limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring .
If you have limited options , try the bathroom .
Make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often .
Depending on the batch of kittens , I will often have as many as one per kitten .
They can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy .
For some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop .
Also if they have diarrhea , check in with your foster coordinator .
They made need medication or deworming or something .
They are testing out their claws and teeth .
To some degree you can / should help teach them not to use their teeth and claws inappropriately .
But in the meantime , highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you 'll be interacting with the kittens .
Then take care of yourself .
Get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy .
Try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time .
Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are .
If you still do n't enjoy the kittens , see what other opportunities are available .
They may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations .. sick , recovering from surgery , need a little socialization , etc .
I find the adults are much easier .
Generally they 're not clawing and biting , they do n't make nearly as much mess , they do n't need nearly as much litterbox scooping , etc :)
Decide volunteering is not your thing and give them back !
And do more research before you agree next time ;-)
Take the kittens back to the shelter .
Maybe do volunteer work at the humane society , walk dogs , groom the animals etc .
what r the requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
what r the evidentary requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
including fees and forms
It depends on if you ever registered the birth .
Some places do the registration right at the hospital .... in some smaller places , you need to register your child 's birth at the town hall / registrar 's office .
My first three children were born in Southern Ontario cities .
The birth registration was done right in hospital .
My last son , was born in Northern Ontario ....
I did n't know that I did n't register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
Two years later when I got around to filling for his birth certificate , I find out he was never registered .
I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as they do n't have an online area for it yet , fill those out , send them away , then apply for his birth certificate .
If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time , it s simple to do it over the computer .
For $ 56 you can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back .
This is in Ontario of course , the rates may be slightly different for other provinces / territories .
You just need basic information , and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at / who was the doctor ....
None , just walk in to the service office and present all the identification you have to prove your identity .
they may then chose to ask you to bring more evidence , or just look up the record and hand you the certificate .
You can probably do it all on - line .
Start here if you were born in Ontario .
http://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/birthcertificates/119274.html
If you were born elsewhere , start here .
http://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/birthcertificates/119275.html
Good luck
My parents did n't send for my birth certificate until I was 16 and needed it for summer employment .
It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
I add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents .
When a child is born in Canada the birth is registered before the baby can leave the hospital .
As long as that was done you can send for it at any time .
Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it .
Royal Caribbean or Carnival cruise ?
ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON BOARD * BOTH * !!
i want to know which you liked better and WHY ?
include which one had :
- better food
- more fun activities
- more teens
- AND JUST MORE STUFF YOU LIKED OVERALL
please specify which royal or carnival ship (:
Carnival and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings .
Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other .
Are there any major differences between them ?
Explore which cruise may fit your needs the best .
For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .
Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St. Thomas , the Bahamas and St. Martin / St. Maarten .
The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .
The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ) .
We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and do n't believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines .
Shows Each night there are a variety of shows .
Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better .
On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act .
If you love seeing the shows , Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians .
Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .
We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas .
Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades .
We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner .
We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty , but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise .
Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have .
They both had pools for kids and adults .
We liked the Liberty 's pools better because one had a slide .
If you have kids , this would be something that they would definitely enjoy .
Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it .
We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas .
Usually you ca n't go wrong when getting a spa treatment ......
Royal Caribbean is better , but the best cruiseline is Regent Seven Seas .
Look on their website rssc.com
Royal Caribbean .
Carnival has been called the WalMart of cruise lines ...
What countries are the best to travel to ?
I really want to travel when I leave school !
Where in the states could I go ?
Where in Europe ?
Have you every traveled before ?
How long should I go for to each place ?
( I Have 1 year before collage ! )
& Also how much money would I need ?
So I can start saving now hehe
Thanks :)
I mean when I graduate & yes , college , sorry for the typo .
Leave High School ?
Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you 've never traveled before and you do n't put where you would be traveling from .
In the United States ?
Lots of places .
There are 50 of them , 48 located from Maine to Florida and California to Washington State and all in between .
There are 2 more located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific .
What do you like to do ?
Big Cities like New York , Boston , Philadelphia on the East Coast .
Beaches and Disney of Florida or the Mid Atlantic cities of Atlanta , Savannah , Charleston .
The federal sites of Washington , DC .
Southern charm of Nashville , Birmingham , New Orleans or Charlotte .
West Coast hot spots like Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , Los Angeles or San Diego .
Europe ?
Just as numerous as the possibilities of the US .
Do you speak a foreign language ?
I could spend a year in Spain alone .
From Madrid to Seville to Barcelona an Valencia .
Bilboa on the north coast , Pamplona and the very famous Guernica .
A road trip to Lisbon and the Algarve in Portugal before a mountain escape in the Pyrenees and a stop in Andorra before heading over to France and Italy and Austria and Switzerland .
I 've traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget , actual time allowed , your likes and dislikes .
Amount of time could be dependent on so many things .
Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place .
Does your budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place ?
You need a lot of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the sites , food , local transport - you name it but life costs .
Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you 'll be able to figure out where you can go , for how long you can go and what you can do when you 're there .
1 year before collage or college ?
Good luck .
I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires .
You ca n't beat the price for what you get .
come to Africa .
Nigeria , a lovely country .
But where in nigeria ?
Obudu cattle ranch .
More than a tourist centre .
How do you make your cat adjust to a new house ?
Me and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town .
We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road .
We have had the cat for 10 years and do nt want to leave it .
How could we make it settle in a new house .
you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory .
territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .
you will need to give him only a small place to explore , so he can make it his territory , and feel safe there .
then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .
you will need to get his box and bowls , and whatever blanket and toys are his , and smell like home , and put him in a room .
the room you sleep in is best ( seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK ) , but others will work just as well .
close the door , and keep him in there for a week .
he will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house .
he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .
he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else 's territory when he is in a new house .
in a week 's time , he will have made it his , and will be getting more bored than afraid .
let him out for half an hour , to explore .
then put him back in .
he will be freaked out , so going back to his territory will make him much happier .
extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .
soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .
remember to visit with him while he is in the room , and tell him how good he is .
remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .
he might even start peeing on things in fear .
good luck with your new house and with his new territory !
Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable .
In time though she / he will adjust . :)
they just do it on their own .
I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors ?
Last night , I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd .
( He is 92 pounds ) He does not listen to any commands , but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command , or even with me .
I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away .
My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate .
I will get a treat and try to get him in there that way , it wo nt work .
He wo nt even get close to the crate .
If I come towards him , he will run away .
How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate ?
and to willingly go outside ... and to come on command .
He wo nt do anything on command .
It s very frustrating .
I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy .
I trained her myself .
She is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw , and she wo nt get it until I give her the command .
Yes , lots of time and lots of patients ...
I just do nt know how to do it with a grown dog .
She tosses me around like it s nothing !
... but basically , what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy ... lots of patience , lots of time , lots of praise , lots of treats , and lots of repition .... Right ?
Is there any tricks I could use ?
Maybe get a book on training .
You have to be in command at all times .
There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out .
I would start with a leash .
Put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times .
Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that .
Later do it again .
When the dog is ok with this , then open the door and walk around the crate , leave the door open all the time .
Put something fun inside .
Let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason .
Do not shut the door .
Let him walk in and out for a few days .
At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all .
Open the door and let him out and see how he acts .
If you push it , it will never work .
With going outside , put the leash on and just take him for a walk .
He will learn to really like this .
Potty outside will come at some point .
Try obedience classes .
Have patience with him , you just got him and who knows how he was treated before you brought him home .
where can I find the best tours to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices ?
will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta .
I have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great .
Should I just settle and book on line ?
or is it better if I wait till I get there ?
If I wait , would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours ?
Also , any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well .
Thank you !
If you want reliable and inexpensive ... try Sinh Cafe / Tourist .
The are located right at 248 De Than St. in the heart of the back packer district .
I have taken this tour and it was great .
I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful .
I do n't remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was .
Also , Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable .
And no , I do not work for them . :)
I am just a satisfied customer .
And do n't expect to party on this tour .
The south is not like the regular tourist towns .
Very few clubs and night activities .
Oh , if you are confused .
Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe .
It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc .
tele # 84838389593
have fun .
There is n't much to see in the delta , it 's a lifestyle not a resort area .
If you 're adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho ( near where we live ) or Can Tho .
From either of those cities , you can venture out and spend a day in the country .
Most of the tourists that I 've come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront .
You take a boat across the river , then spend a day biking , eating at a local restaurant , buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists .
The countryside is very beautiful , especially if you have a few months ( or years ) to get to know the place .
PS , If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre , stay a night at my friend Ken 's hotel .
It 's called Kiwi Heaven and it 's across the river from Cho Ben Tre .
It 's a little hard to get to by foot , they 're rebuilding the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
He 's an ex-pat from New Zealand and he 's been in town for awhile .
He 'll set up a real tour of the area for you , not some tourist fantasy .
Have a good trip where - ever you end up .
We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip , but they do offer this one day separately .
We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies , visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm , rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout .
Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different .
yoga and horses ..... ?
I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss 's fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is .
I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga .
But there are just so many poses and programs !
Any good poses or programs ( I 'm willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops .
Because I do n't feel like spending over $ 20 on a freakin DVD
I also have back problems that transfer into my legs .
I have done Yoga for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube ( I think it s called " Yoga for horse back riding " hosted by a man ) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution helped not really for the way I use my legs and back .
Here is what I do now and it really helps ....
When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
Then the same thing with the other leg .
Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can , so they are not touching the saddle .
Then a lap doing scissors , one leg forward as far as I can and the other back , then switch legs .
I 'll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet .
If the weight is going into your heels ( it throws your leg forward ) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot .
Do a nice working trot , not a slow trot .
All this will help you use both legs evenly , keep proper contact and use your wight correctly , to keep your leg in a good position .
BTW you do nt want your leg locked in place , it will move WITH the horse a bit .
When I first started doing it I 'd do it every day .
Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed .
Now not only is my leg better , but my back is relaxing .
what are you having problems with ?
i would n't bother with yoga i 'd practice more with riding and fixing my problem , ride bareback , with no irons , there s also a way to ride on your knees ?
that help alot with your thigh muscles ( bareback though )
ya i really would n't bother with the yoga
maybe a back brase will help , sometimes my back really gets to me and i 've thought about getting one .
with your leg flopping , just try putting all your weight in your heel and hang on with only your legs , holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it 's forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles , maybe try standing on the edge of your steps ( on the ball of your foot ) and balance to strengthen those muscles
You do n't want to spend more than $ 20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses ?
I really ca n't help you .
What to feed my dog after gastroenteritis ?
My dog has been sick for about 3 days now .
He has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit last night .
I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and would nt drink any water .
I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal .
No pancreatitis or anything abnormal .
The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics .
So my question is ..
Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis ?
and will these antibiotics help ?
I have tryed to give him water but he wo nt take it .. what should i do ?
i do nt want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food ?
... Some help would be great .
thank you :)
They did nt take x - rays they offered them but i just could nt afford any more treatment .
I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wo nt be buying grocerys for the next few weeks .
I will give them and call and see what they say .
Thank you for the help .
Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
Seince he recieved the fluids last night he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000 etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info it s greatly appreciated .
To answer your questions in order :
1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .
However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .
He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .
Did your vet take radiographs ( x - rays ) ?
2 ) Your vet would not prescribe them if they did n't think it would be helpful .
3 ) If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .
It could be due to nausea or any number of things .
He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ) .
From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances , which can lead to heart and kidney problems .
And being dehydrated , vomiting , and having diarrhea just does n't feel good .
4 ) Call your vet .
They should have discussed a bland diet with you , including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting .
It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his hydration , administer the antibiotics IV , and to ensure that he starts to recover .
You should ABSOLUTELY call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about .
They have seen your pet , and are most aware of his condition .
No one online will be able to assist you more than your vet can .
You need to ask your vet these questions .
Boiled WHITE rice and boiled chicken breast .
Bland food .
NO SPICES !
My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot , it could be a sign of obstruction .
Did they do any x - rays ?
I do n't know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment .
You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not .
French dating etiquette ?
I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this .
I 'm in my 20's and currently studying in France .
Coming from an anglo - saxon country my version of dating is ' getting the number , asking her out , etc. . '
However , I 've read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different .
For them , dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties , then pairing off .
In addition , from my understanding one - on - one dates is something that comes much later and not ' straight - away ' like us anglo - saxons .
They are also very secretive about being in a relationship .
They only ' go out in the open ' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness .
Is it true ?
I have told a French girl I liked her , and she accepted .
She is friendly when we see each other on campus .
She is also nicer when we are both alone .
However , when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me .
She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date , to the point she said stop !
My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along .
But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary .
Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap ?
What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios .
You are not French for a start , so the " rules " or " customs " may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds .
From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear .
She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend .
You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you .
At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you , which is consistent .
Take the messages for what they are : she has no objection in you being pals at uni , but she does not want to take matters further .
" Non ! " means " non " , not " I might consider it , and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case . "
Christiane gave you a good answer .
You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding .
What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends , there 's nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends , which is obviously what this girl wants from you .
She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make you understand that she does n't want to go further .
If she is nicer when you are alone I 'd say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend .
You do find the ' get the number hop in bed with her ' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts .
Unfair for the girl as boys do n't have that kind of handicap , but that 's the way our own rules work .
Should have done research before you left .
Why not just take your chances and do it your way ?
True or false : being a young New Zealander means having no future ?
There are no jobs in this country .
I 'm just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry .
Is there a future for our nation 's youth ?
@ Ryan B ,
I 'm two years into an undergraduate degree .
Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available .
Everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas , to Australia , etc .
There 's obviously a reason for that ( lack of employment , low incomes , etc . )
Your answer does n't do anything but remind me that I 'm going to be $ 25,000 in debt by the time I 'm 22 .
So , thanks .
@ W.a.b.b.y ,
I really like you're answer .
it 's very logical .
I 've also considered becoming a teacher , but it 's not a job I 'm cut out for .
I also wish I 'd applied for a scholarship .
I did n't think I 'd be awarded one , but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school , so my chances were probably better than I thought they were .
Obviously I 'm still completely stupid though .
I mean , I was n't smart enough to apply for a scholarship .
And yes , I am being melodramatic .
Lol .
@ Hatmanone ,
* gasps * So I would n't make a good prostitute ?
Are you saying I 'm bad in bed ?
How would you know ?
Joking .
Your answer is very sweet , but I 'm not compassionate towards teenage high school students .
A little mellow dramatic ?
In my opinion , far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees .
Yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting , but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications ?
I 'm studying to be a teacher , so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I 'm done .
I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland , but at least I can be pretty sure I 'll be employable .
I 've also got a bachelor s degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession .
I also know that you do n't get paid that much more in Australia than you do here .
And it 's not all about how much you earn , cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia .
Try living in Sydney on a teacher 's salary , then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago .
You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia .
It 's probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan .
At the moment there 's no interest , but that 'll probably change .
And they 'll probably add interest to what you 've already racked up .
And they 're working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back .
At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they 'll force you cough up .
And all that time you 're overseas you 'll be racking up interest .
I would n't like not having the option to return to NZ .
I guess I 'm extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800 f my course fees through my degree .
But I worked hard and I 'm still working hard .
There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap .
My 2 c. ....
Get an education !
I 'm doing fine .
Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground , do n't assume it 's better in Oz .
People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20 + years , so it 's not anything new .
It depends on what you hunger for .

why does my baby king snake refuse to eat ?
i have a baby eastern king snake .
i have tried EVERYTHING i can to get him to eat but he refuses .
he has a great environment , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp .
as far as i know , everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned .
according to the vet , he is healthy and looks good .
he has been going to the bathroom like he should .
( i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom wo n't eat . )
he has been drinking water ( i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl , but also i have been feeding him water and he does n't ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down . )
i handle him every few days .
he is feisty , as most king snakes are , but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything .
i just love him to death .
i do n't know why he wo n't eat though !
i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen ( thawed ) pinkies .
i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is .
i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he wo n't touch the pinky .
he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them .
he does n't seem to know that they are food .
i have tried " braining " both live and dead pinkies , and bloodying them up to get his attention , but he does n't care .
i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice , and in used gerbil bedding .
i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake 's face .
he wo nt even try to bite .
i am very discouraged and sad and i do n't know what to do .
he has n't eaten in an entire month .
i 've only tried to feed him one at a time .
he 's just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
do babies this small hibernate ?
When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him ?
If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry .
If he does n't seem interested in them at all I would say he 's just not hungry .
My boyfriend has one and when she 's hungry she attacks the pinkie right away .
They can smell it so i 'm sure he knows what it is and just do n't want it .
Remember snakes can go a while without eating .
In the winter , they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like state called brumation , which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity .
King snakes sometimes stop eating , particularly during the cooler part of the year .
They have a natural instinct to hibernate .
If the snake is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation .
Hibernation is natural , and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred .
Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding .
You can tell when your king snake is about to shed , because its eyes will get milky looking .
Its body will be dull looking , too .
In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin .
For example , some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter , feeding mainly in spring and fall .
It 's natural and so long as you do n't see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about .
You see , some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food .
They 're fit and healthy and their care is suitable .
hope this helped .
That 's why it 's good to have a python !
It 's twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month .
are my two cats fighting or playing ?
how rough is too rough ?
help !?
i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten .
the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that .
the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing ( chasing each other up and down the hall , rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other ) .
only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine .
were they roughhouse playing ?
or were they actually fighting ?
he has been " biting " at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so i m wondering if he went a little to far that one time .
any answers help !!!!!!
you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough .
you need to do that for a least a week , or else this type of territorial fighting will happen .
giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared .
right now , your male is fighting off an intruder , and he feels that all of the house is his .
put her back in the room , and keep the door closed for a week .
then let her out for ten minutes .
make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on .
this will do two things ; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room , making it her territory .
she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she does n't now .
she knows she is invading someone else 's territory , but ca n't help it , and has no where to go .
she will be able to sleep without being afraid .
as well , your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened .
when the door opens , he will get that the one room is hers , and he will be OK with that .
the territory thing will be solved .
your male is hurting her to put her in her place - biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting - to pull the guts out of their prey .
this is not good .
give them time to set up their territories , and once you bring the new kitten out , pay a lot of attention to the male .
you have brought someone else into his territory , and he needs to be reminded that you still love him , and support his claim to his space .
that will help to reassure him , and he will be less aggressive with her .
when they play fight , they do n't hiss .
if they hiss , they are not playing .
if they bite , and one cries , you must separate them , and you must keep an eye on them .
hissing is OK , unless they start to fight .
if that happens , separate them , and give them time apart .
putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid , and she will relax .
good luck !
A hiss is basically a " get the f*ck away " sound .
It means they 've gone too far .
When they start bleeding that means they 're really fighting .
If they 're going kinda slow and like fake biting ( not biting as hard as they can ) , and fake scratching ( not hitting as hard as they can with their paws ) then they 're playing .
I have two cats , and at first they hissed at each other because cats are very territorial , but now they do fight and play .
The difference is when the cat hisses , that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away .
That means they are fighting .
When they are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that they are playing .
I can see how you get confused though . :)
What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive ?
When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half - million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam .
He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years ( before the next election in 1968 ) .
He did not give them the number of troops they requested .
This left Westmoreland with few options , so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is , in the long run , the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency .
Thing is , it worked .
The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC ( the guerilla movement ) , they were being challenged by the Main Force VC ( which was light infantry ) and the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) .
When the Americans swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the Communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the US firepower , and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in Laos and Cambodia .
All those sunny reports about the progress in Vietnam were correct , the Communists WERE being defeated .
However , Johnson would not let the military cross the borders and clean out the Communist bases .
He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack , but he ignored his military advisers .
The Communists agreed .
They could not defeat the Americans .
However , what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations .
The Communists thought they could defeat the ARVN , cause the fall of the South Vietnamese government , and the people would than rally to the Communist cause and leave the Americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants .
THAT WAS THE PLAN .
What happened ?
The Americans detected the attempt to infiltrate the urban areas and were already redeploying troops from the rural areas .
The ARVN rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked .
Within 24 hours every Communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of Hue .
The government did NOT fall .
And the South Vietnamese people ?
When give the ultimate choice , they rallied ???
TO THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT ???.
Tet was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists .
They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit .
The people rejected their attempt to topple the government , and for all intents and purposes the US military ( and the ARVN ) handed Johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time - frame he ordered it .
All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces .
But Johnson was so obtuse he did n???t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter .
Instead he pulled the military off , stopped the bombing of North Vietnam , withdrew from the presidential race , and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam .
They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it .
The American people were NOT having any of it , and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made ( not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding ) .
In the end Nixon kept his promise for ??? ??? peace with honor ???. ???
But that ???s another question .
To emancipate the south , but it was a serious failure .
To make the war unpalatable to the American public .
In that , they pretty much succeeded .
Before Tet , the war was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of American lives was seen as the cost of subduing the VC and NVA .
Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight .
There is a very good book on the subject that was written by General Vo Nguyen Giap .

Bearded dragon question ... ?
I just bought a baby one yesterday .
I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat , but the " sun rays " he needs ?
I also was wondering how long should this light be on .
The lady at pet smart said 4 hours , but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours .
He 's getting used to his new home , but has n't eatin yet .
I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze - dried crickets .
Any advice would be greatly appreciated .
Thank you for your time .
Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of " light , " UVA , UVB , and heat .
Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA , including heat bulbs , that 's the easy one to provide for .
UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source .
UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a MVB ( mercury vapor bulb ) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb .
I highly recommend that you do not use coiled / compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and / or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time .
The long tube UVB bulbs are best , like Zoomed 's Repsitun model : http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturer s recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is .
So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have " the sun 's rays " that your bearded needs .
You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting .
The person at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you ; they do n't have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info .
UVB and basking temp ( should be about 110 F for a baby , 95 F for an adult ) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day .
Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source ; you need to offer live feeder insects .
Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response , especially when they are babies .
Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried .
Crickets , silk worms , phoenix worms , and various feeder roaches , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded .
Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items , for variety 's sake .
I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly :
http://herp-info.webs.com/beardeddragon.htm
http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=1
mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i 'm concerned .
if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3 x 5 x 4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if it s a small tank and he ca n't escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven .
as to what the light provides it gives UV rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans .
That lady at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates ... sheesh .
Yes , it gives him the " sun rays " necessary , that 's what UVA is .
And it should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment .
As for the heat , just be sure to use a thermometer .
Also , Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving , so it s anyone 's guess whether or not he 'll touch the freeze - dried crickets or the processed food .
I tell all my customers they can try it , but do n't count on it .
Also try green leafy veggies , like kale and spinach .
Best of luck !
Is a finch or a parakeet better ?
I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like , and i was wondering : which would not bite alot , and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly do nt care but my family does !
Please help me !
oh and please say y one is better thx !!!!!!
Hi there ,
Please choose the parakeet ...
Here s my reason .....
I did the same thing that you did for christmas .
I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas .
At first it was all cool and all .
They were chirping and doing their every day business .
After a couple of weeks I got tired of them .
They are quite messy and you can not hold or pet them .
I ve tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed .
They do nt want to be held or touched .
I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks .
I still have them and they are doing well .
A couple of months after I got parakeets / budgies .
They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality .
I love them .
First of all they are very tame .
I tamed them in 4 days .
They can do tricks and they are nt messy .
The whole family loves them .
My parents even plays with them .
They are a big part of our family .
I hope this helps you with your decision .
They are both about the same noise level .
When choosing a parakeet look for a young one .
( the younger the eaiser to tame ) Look for clean smooth feathers , beak , and clean vent feathers ( the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy ) Look for a dark eye with no circles ( the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes ) .
Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird .
the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older .
( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers .
If you want a boy the cere ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .
The girl has either pink or brown .
I would recommend that you get two parakeets .
But get either one male and one female , or two males .
Do not get two females .
They sometimes do nt get along ( you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girls tend to fight a lot .
I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .
They are the best !
If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them .
However if you plan on getting one , then get more than one at the same time they need company .
My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results .
It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
These are the steps I used .
Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets .
Hopefully they will work for you .
1 ) When you get the bird , place him or her or them in the cage .
Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours .
2 ) Then place you hand in the cage .
I took the cage and place it next to the couch .
Then I sat on the couch , placed one hand in the cage , holding a millet spray .
( this way the will associate your hand with food , and birds love food lol ) Then I turned on the tv and watch .
This way they will see that your hand is good and it s not going to grab them or hurt them .
Do this for about one hour .
( you can take breaks if you have too ) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours .
3 ) After about day 2 , they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand .
( do not take away the food dish from the birds , they will associate you as the person who takes away their food ) ....
Then take your finger and place it under their belly , in front of their feet and say up .
Push you finger to their feet gently and say up .
( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you do nt jump back or screem they will get used to you ) They will have no choice but to go on your finger .
When they see that you ar nt harming them , the will go up on your finger when you say up .
4 ) If they are not going up by now you just got ta keep trying and keep trying .
Do not hit , yell , or harm them .
You have patience .
Do nt give up !
After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder , when I say up it means to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage .
and when I say go home it means to go in the cage .
Good luck !
They worked for me and I hope they worked for you !
They are awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And that s my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch .
a parakeet is friendlier
Parakeet .
They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them .
They are also friendly .
I have a parakeet named Cookie . :P
When is the best time to travel to Ireland ?
My sister and I would like to go to Ireland .
I graduate in the spring , and so we 'd like to go between then and winter .
We do n't want too many tourists , and since we 'll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November .
We do n't want it to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months ) , but we do n't feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either .
We 're both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we 're still young and before our lives start to get even crazier !
Can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to Ireland would be ?
People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .
One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of .
It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February , but winter woollies in March and even during the summer .
And then there ???s the rain .
Ireland receives a lot of rain , with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year .
County Kerry is the worst affected .
The southeast is the driest , enjoying a more continental climate .
The Irish weather works on the ??? four seasons in a day ??? principle , which basic??ally means that you ca n???t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .
Some basic assumptions , however , can be made .
In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and ??? most importantly ??? very long : at the height of summer you wo n???t need to turn on lights until after 10 pm .
It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .
Not surprisingly , most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather .
Spring ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good alternatives , although the country ???s ever - growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid - and high - season tourism .
Still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid-July ??? again , it ???s all part of the uncertainty principle .
Spring festivities include the ever - popular St Patrick ???s Festival .
Although temperatures do not often venture below freezing , winter ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge parts of the country ??? the west and northwest in particular .
Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country ???s tourist attractions and services close down in October and do n???t reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it ???s cold , grey and dark by 5 pm , but there ???s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .
The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you , clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up .
Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..
As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says " there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes "
Afraid I can not be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
If you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .
The summer there is much more mild than most of the US ( are you coming from the US ? ) .
Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall .
It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .
September for example .
Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime .
To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural places do n't have a bus or train service .
You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists .
By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way .
Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .
We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24 C on a few occasions , more like 14 C most days .
We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions .
Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender .
The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter , windier & colder .
We had frosts in October so I would n't advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring time is your best bet .
You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland ?
You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights , insurance , food , accommodation & spending money .
Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America I believe .
Golden Wonder KilliFish Breeding Help ?
I have 4 Golden Wonder Killifish .
1 of them is really colorful and is about 6 cm long .
2 of them are kinda whitish and are about 4 - 5 cm long .
The last one is colourful too but it is about 4 cm long .
I feed them Flakes , and Live Earthworms uncut everyday .
Can you tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies ?
Thanks in Advance .
Wow !
If they are able to take earthworms uncut , that is really impressive !
I aspire to your feeding regime , flakes early and something live later in the day .
Worms ( and Daphnia ) are also rich in Lipids , substances important in forming eggs and growing young .
I think that you understand that your largest and smallest golden wonders are males .
If you would like more on sexing out Aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below .
If you have plants in your tank .
your lineatus are already spawning .
If conditions are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are , they will spawn .
( I 've even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer !
If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop .
Check out the second source .
I prefer darker colors because I can see their eggs , more easily and the fish look better next to them .
Use a well rinsed medicine vial , a cork , new fishing bobber or even a piece of non-crumbly styrofoam to float them .
There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks , picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated , seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there .
If you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & females ( s ) , & feed them well on live foods , ( assuming that you are doing weekly 50 % water changes ) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs .
Just making up examples , but if a pair is constantly together , they may lay 10 - 15 eggs a day .
With extra blackworms and maybe frozen ( defrosted , rinsed ) frozen foods earlier in the day , they may leave 30 - 40 eggs at a time .
Separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff , they may produce more .
Separating a pair some time before a show ( killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs ) will encourage them to court and show their best colors .
They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins .
The water changes help with that too .
You also may need to treat the incubation water .
The chlorine and ammonia ( choramine ) are not good for the eggs .
Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to " breathe " .
Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult 's desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone .
If a pair is n't leaving eggs ... check the following :
1 . Is a tank mate ( such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails ) rating the eggs ?
2 . Have we kept up with partial water changes ?
3 . Is there too much mineral in the water ?
Aplo. lineatus are wide - spread over southern India .
That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries .
Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS ( total Dissolved Solids ) test , that may give you a hint .
Winging it a little here , a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 PPM ( parts per million ) or 5.8 to 10.6 DH should be fine for gardneri .
TDS meters ( the thrifty aquarist 's hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department 's annual reports .
They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals ( calcium , magnesium and iron ) .
A number of minerals are not of much consequence .
However if there is a high level of sodium chloride ( common salt ) that can break down the chorion ( shell ) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo . )
Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .
THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to " breathe " .
If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial , that is fine .
But get the eggs out , maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water .
In time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container .
After a number of people began complaining about " mystery deaths " among incubating eggs , some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the eggs develop , they do release waste material .
Another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs .
Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus , so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper .
Other will add a drop of Methylene blue .
If an egg turns blue , it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down .
Get those out ASAP too .
Hope there is useful grist for the mill here .
Disney cruise line with young ones ?
I will be taking my 3 and 4 yr olds .
What is the best time of year ?
Should I get a balcony ?
Any tips or advice to make this a great experience ??
Thanks !!!
It is vacation time .
Many families are set to plan a best holidaying .
They look for fun filled , rejuvenating and memorable vacation .
There can be many ideas ; one can see numerous options passing through their mind .
What is the best option ?
Especially if you are planning to spend couple days with family and kids , which best suit you can select ?
Disney cruises , is a simple answer to this .
There are many reasons to say Disney cruise is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour .
From 1998 onwards , from its inception Disney cruise has attracted many and continue to attract more and more .
This is a spectacular ship , a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure time .
The ship is designed thematically , with imposing animated cartoon characters .
Do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones ?
No , the luxurious facilities and fun filled activities in the Disney cruise are very attractive to people of all ages .
Whatever be the age , you will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day - to - day activities .
Kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities .
There are two ships , Disney magic and Disney wonder .
Both are made keeping in mind the comforts of the travelers .
Disney cruises offer 24 - hour room services , and the crews are ready to serve you the way you like .
It has got very spacious rooms , furnished completely and neatly .
These are decorated uniquely and marvelously .
The ship offers variety of eatables , deliciously made .
Sea fishes , prawns and many nice options are there in different restaurants aboard .
There are many good options of delicious food on the shores as well .
There are special regions uniquely and imposingly designed for the children .
They can spend many hours enjoying the Disney world magic .
These theme parks have all types of facilities .
Video shows , cartoon stories , wonderful games and many such facilities .
It is really an entertainment for the kids .
The amusing world of cartoons and stories will be a memorable experience for the children .
There are other amnesties also .
These include space for dances and music , bar facility , gambling facilities for the elder , spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities .
Also one can keep their privacy in the cabins and make the time in seclusion .
To relax and to rejuvenate Disney cruise are the best option .
There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates .
You can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking ........
Off season is good , however , the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked .
I would suggest a warmer season , but not Spring Break or early summer .
You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays .
We REALLY enjoyed our balcony -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving port -- however , it is quite a bit more expensive .
With young ones , I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside .
Check out the kids ' space as soon as you get onboard .
Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there .
They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there , the sooner they can have fun .
We liked getting the late dinner seating , so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are ' early to bed ' you may want the earlier seating for dinners .
Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door .
All of the doors tend to look alike and having ' something ' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier .
You can also leave notes for the rest of your family ( husband ) about where you are at any given point .
Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a ' walkie - talkie ' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard .
Each evening you will get a ' magazine ' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day .
We always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we ' had ' to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling .
Any time would be great .
off season cruises might actually be better with preschoolers as prices might be lower in the off season .
My wife and I , in our 60's at the time , originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel .
We had a ball .
We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend .
There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted .
The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones .
The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities .
There is a splash fountain ( no standing water ) for little ones still in diapers ; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained ; Then a family pool ; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed .
You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise .
If you stay with your dining schedule , every night is dinner and a show .
The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise .
Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife 's taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare .
Since they knew our preferences , we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did .
Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it .
If you should miss a meal , you also missed a great show .
but food is always available and it is consistently good .
I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise .
This is about my farrier , girls .
That 's why I 'm posting here !
Help ?
I posted this in singles and dating too , so I 've just copied and pasted .
Well , I 'll try to make this short .
I have known this guy for a long time , but we 've never been good friends or anything .
He is my farrier ( shoes my horse s feet ) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way .
Well , almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horse s feet and was SO flirty .
He always hugs me when he comes , but he gave me at least 5 tight , long , back rubbing hugs while he was there .
We were also just talking about my horse 's crappy feet and he mentioned .
" Well , if you ever just want to see me I 'll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after . "
That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested .
Right ??
Anyway , so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horse s foot ( I 've never heard of a farrier doing this ) and telling me to call him in a few days ( first it was a week , then it was a few days lol ) and he 'd come back out and put it in .
He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left .
So , I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
Anyway , so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message , but he still has n't called back yet .
I do n't know if I should call him again tomorrow or not ?
I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you , but it 's different because I 'm a client and technically that 's all I am at this point .
On the other hand though , if I 'm a client he should really of called back by now because you do n't leave a customer hanging .
He did n't have my number either because this was the first time I 've called HIM instead of his dad .
It 's a father and son business .
Anyway , I would appreciate ANY insight on this at all .
Thank you for reading if you did ! :)
Ok , well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case , they are extremely well known farriers in the area .
I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail .
The reason he said he did n't put that nail in was because he " did n't want to risk it " with my horse 's horrible feet .
This is about the fourth time they 've done my horse 's feet because I just switched back to them .
The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
However , he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now that 's what I call a crap farrier ) .
Which , I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails .
So , obviously I switched back to these guys .
Ok , calm down , it 's not like he 's some stranger that came up and groped me lol .
I 've known the guy for about 10 years .
I am 21 , so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other !
He is a few years older than me .
And yes , I do like him .
To answer Barry White , yes that did occur to me :) I hope that is all he 's waiting for .
On the other hand , he could very easily just call me and say hey I 'm busy right now , I 'll call you when I can come out .
And as far as scheduled visits go , I have no idea .
I 've never done that before though either .
It 's always just " Okay , they're feet need to be done , better call the farrier . "
And they usually come out within a few days .
He will call you back I m sure !
Sounds like He really likes you ..
But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way ?
would You like going for * coffee * with him ?
or is he Not your type ?
Or are you undecided ?
If i were you I would Go ...
I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get ?
I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming ..
Edit ... I really do nt think Your horse Is in danger Of being hurt With one Nail missing ..
I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to ...
I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horse s Hoof condition and It s a added bonus he would get to see her again
When I was Younger In my early 20s My farrier was A hottie named Joby .. ( for those who do n't Know I AM A GIRL read my Bio on my Page ) dumb as a post about everything But horses ..
He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
sort a wonder what it would have been like ?
But That was Years ago .
He had this Habit of telling you Everything ..
Well one day he said to me You know i do n't wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mare s Right front hoof .. and I was Like Ummmm okay ???
I m glad his butt was facing me so he could n't see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing ..
Well 6 weeks Later when he came back out He was again working on my mare s front Foot and I looked Down and Yeah he had Wholes In his pants In the wrong places I bust out Laughing and He was like what ???
I was like Ummmm i can see your ass cheeks ... he was like Oops did i forget my Underwear ???
that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
But like i said nothing ever came of It .. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up ..
I was heartbroken .. but then realized He was not the Guy for me ..
Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but do n???t leave a message so you do n???t have to necessarily wait for him to call .
From the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationships , he 's doing a really shitty job .
Leaving nails out so you 'll call and have him come back out later ?
Cute or not , I 'd call a different bloke because he 's doing a sub-par job at something he needs to be doing his best at , whether he 's flirting or trying to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
This is , after all , his business , and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work ?
EPM , Anyone Dealt with it ?
Might be something different ?
I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .
He 's not lame , but he 's been having issues .
Here 's what the owner has said :
I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .
I chalked it up to possible nerve damage , because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems .
So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels .
I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday ( I expected him to drop some ) .
He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day .
Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems .
He can eat all his feed and does n't drop any , but can not eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it .
He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle .
The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead .
The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life .
I CAN NOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him .
NO , I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam .
We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs .
He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy .
He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws .
So I might get the horse and see what I can do .
I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him , have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test .
Will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well .
My other theory would be wobblers .
I 'll be having my equine chiro / acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him ....
So any ideas ?
Think I should do it ?
Arby ,
Horse is out of state and not local .
Owner is willing to meet me half way with him .
I will be calling my vet and chiro about him .
Worse comes to worse , I 'm out of the $ $ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament .
He 's still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle .
This is a horse that I otherwise would n't be able to afford and even if I spend 2 K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price .
I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3 , that is not me to clarify .
She is the one that ca n't afford to do anything else for him in case he does n't recover fully .
He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he ca n't eat regular hay .
I do n't think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain .
I am not going to go pick up a horse I ca n't afford .
I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat .
The owner is the one who is unable .
I will also be having my other vet up who 's a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers .
July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
He 's only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( which could or could n't be related ) .
The horse is not in pain .
He 's not starving .
He 's dropping we
The horse is not in pain .
He 's not starving .
He 's dropping weight , but most of that came from being at the trainer s and being ridden hard for 60 days .
He 's not putting it back on .
I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down .
At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM .
I know this is going to be expensive .
I 'm willing to give it a shot .
Gallop , I 've already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well .
Looked at studies , treatment options and such .
I will have the EPM test done before treating .
The chiro / acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM .
If that is the case then acupuncture is n't going to hurt him .
It 's actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before you decide to take this horse on .
I do think some Y!A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I ca n't comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse .
Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down .
Is that something you are up for ?
If so go for it and I 'll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up .
It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horses are worth the risk .
If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out .
As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we 've had to deal with it .
Pretty much every large stable has here .
Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada .
We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there .
That horse returned to racing and we did n't notice much difference .
We 've had a few since then , but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida .
I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers , but we have n't had an EPM horse in at least 10 years .
I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing .
One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM .
We 've always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1 / 2 mile .
The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after .
It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns .
I do n't know .
MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here .
You may want to see if you can get in touch with their EPM group and get this guy in a study .
I know they did lab work showing that Strongid C used daily could help prevent EPM .
I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now , but it may be some time before those results are released .
Another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be West Nile ?
West Nile can cause EPM like symptoms and does n't always include a fever .
Let us know what you decide to do .
You hate to see talent get wasted , but honestly I do n't think I could take in a horse right now these issues .
Personally I think you should just keep on walking by .
You should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not .
If you have a good repoire ( which I 'm sure you do ) with them , they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...
Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh , there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future .
So all in all , put the money up front before taking on this horse .
A few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name .
Could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy ?
Or a difficult birth ?
Was it always like this ?
Or has it occurred since birth .
I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke ?
I think if you can not afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect .
Who knows what the future might hold , and it might be expensive ?
Extremely bad customer service
Do not go to this salon , especially if you have to get your hair straightened .
They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it did n't work for my hair .
Rude , insensitive , discourteous people !!!!!
Great Doc
Dr Greenwalt fixed my neck from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor .
He did nt prescribe pain meds or other drugs , he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable .
My neck is fixed !.
He knows what he s doing .

Great pet care
I have used Just Like Family several times now and they have provided great care for my two dogs .

I highly recommend her .

Great Doctor !
Dr. Faris is a great doctor !

Great pub
Had a meal in this pub and i have to say it was excellant .
It has to be one of the nicest pubs that i have been into in a long time , the decor is nice and it has a really nice garden and a lovely decking area .
Good beer good service and what more could you want .
awful awful awful
This store is by far the worst Verizon store I 've been in .
The salespeople are never available , the lines are always too long , and all the people want is a sale .
Incredibly rude and I will not return to it .
Is there no other Verizon to go to around Downtown / Dupont Circle 1?!?!?
Great graphic design work !
Fresh Design Studio helped jump - start my own business by providing affordable and effective marketing materials : logo , flyers , posters ad design , and more .

Staff explained insurance procedures and was very helpful .
Everyone was very nice .

I 've been to quite a few tattoo shops around this area and Stainless Steel is by far the best .
I am very pleased with the tattoos that I revived from them .
The artwork is excellent and the prices are very reasonable .
I would recommend this shop to anyone looking to get a tattoo .
Cathy ****** Five Stars for Lake Forest Tots .

Check out their wine tastings every Friday night !
A +
Excellent customer service and honest feedback .
The team at Bradley Chevron kept my car running for well past its expected death !
They are honest about ' immediate ' concerns versus ' recommended ' repairs and have very fair prices .
Such a convenient location as well with coffee shop and bradley food and beverage right around corner .
Needs to go out of business
They close whenever they feel like it , often well before their listed closing time .
Their store is dusty , dirty and feels like you 're stepping into the 1970s .
They do n't take coupons .
They have a credit card minimum .
This place is the opposite of QuikTrip : crappy in every way .
Where else can you go for $ 10 and recieve this treatment ?!
Awesome haircut at awesome price right here in Palatine !
Who can pass up a hot towel and a straight edge neck shave !
I 've had 2 cuts now from Georgia and have paid more in other salons / barbershops and have not received this kind of treatment or cut !
Baffled by the one - star reviews
I do n't get it .
This place is awesome , with a great ambiance and cool d??cor , and the food is scrumptious ( and especially their signature banana split ) .
Sure , some items are a little pricey , but c'm on ... have you ever been out to eat in Seattle before ?
I 've only had good experiences at Adorn , I was greeted and offered a refreshment .
I highly recommend Debi , she does an amazing job , I " love " the way she cuts my hair , extremely thorough and cross checks her work to make sure my hair is perfect .
I always leave loving my hair style .
Best Chineese food in the area
The food here is fresh and hot out of the Wok .
The food is cooked fast by the two chefs on duty .
The lunch specials are more food than most people can eat for about $ 6 .
It is busy every day at lunch for a reason , the service is fast and the food is great .
Pure Pilates !!
It is the real thing - I have been practicing Pilates for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else .
It is the attention to detail and the quality of the work taught at TomiPilates that sets this studio apart from the others .
The teachers are highly trained and are expert at handling all types of clients .
I phoned this company for advice on our office refurb and although we did not use them in the end ( as our building contractor carried out the electrical work ) , they provided me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we are now using PJC as our electrical maintenance contractor .
Thoroughly recommended
They really go above and beyond !
For example , I actually forgot to feed my cat , and they went out of their way to take care of him .
Additionally , when there was confusion ( my fault ) , they left me flowers along with a personalized gift .
They have been 100 % reliable and professional .
Definitely recommend !
heating system Angels

Comfort zone came out and did my house heat on the cheap .

Thank you Comfort Zone
Slowest , Unfriendly Sstaff on Weekends
There are three Starbucks locations that I frequent .
I have a bit of experience watching the usual assembly line .
I also understand that weekend staffs are different than daytime staffs and not necessarily Starbucks A - team or even full - time .
But this location has the worst weekend staff I 've seen EVER .
Skip te rest - this is the best
Absolutely great !
Clean , updated room , friendly staff , safe location .
Staff is super friendly , treat you as a friend .
Can not ask for a better experience .
Will be staying here any and every time I come anywhere near .
Overall , Joe is a happy camper who has found a great spot .
PHOTOS DONE WELL
I Love Hellada Gallery !
Marek Dzida the owner and photographer puts whole heart in his business - If you are into old fashion ( Not Digital ) quality photography this is best place in Long Beach as I think not many folks can do affordable traditional photos anymore I know Marek personaly and I will always recommend him
BAD COFFEE , DO NT BOTHER !
Ca n't you make a decent cup of coffee ?
You charge SO MUCH , yet you use the same grounds over and over again .
The coffee taste BURNT and very bitter .
No amount of sugar and milk can mask it .
CHANGE THE PROCESS , PPL !
Westfield and Rt 1 do it well , WHY CA NT U ????
Home made product
I sometimes go into this store just for something to do on a sunday afternoon .
I love the people , the product and the service !
Nothing compares to a home made product that really stands the test of time . -
The Brick , Ikea , and Leon 's have their place .
But furniture like this will truly be around forever .
The internet here is terrible .
Like the previous poster said , the com lines are split between the entire building .
That 's 3 x worse than Qwest DSL 's lowest speed offering !
The outward appearance makes you think this place is nice , but everything inside is cheap cheap cheap .
Moving out as soon as our lease is up .

Awesome !!!!
Yes my G 1 screen is back working .
They was about to Charge me $ 129 ...
But i paid $ 100 .
they save me from having to deal with Tmobile ...
Tmobile want to Send of my phone and i did n't want to go thru that ...
3 Days For get that ...
Great service .
I would recommend them to anyone ..
Great out night !
You ca n't go wrong with Tuesday prices , even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians !
Extensive drink list and daily specials but wish they had a bit more on their food menu , although popcorn is a nice touch !
( other items : chicken fingers , wings , asian pizza , and yam and regular fries )
Their food and sweets are awesome .
But service is very poor .
Attitude of staff very bad .
Never gives a receipt .
Sometimes even gives wrong dish .
So confused at the payment area .
Line up is so stupid .
Even if you line up .
To make a order you may have to go to back of line .
And then wait again .
Not organised .
Hair By Nivine in eastgardens fixed my hair after i had my hair cut and colored at another salon i felt more confident and the girls are fantastic and i ve been going there now for 2 years always happy and they care about my hair had my hair done for my wedding it looked fabolous !
and there prices are really good !
Best food in northeast
There s a reason why Frank mcclelland was named best chef of the north east reigon .
Food here is absolutely superb .
Everything is delicous and cooked perfectly .
The waiting staff is beyond impeccable ( they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom ) .
If you want great food then L'espalier is the place to go .
I did n't end up buying my car here , but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me .
Also they will fill your tires with air and other small maintenance tasks for free , even if you did n't buy your car there !
The Best Deals in Town
Before you buy ANYTHING in NY , make sure you stop by Jack -s first .
Their selection is random , so what they have on a given week might never be available again at the store .
I love it for discounted beauty items and household appliances .
Trust me , you go there once and you -ll always go back !
First Time Ballerina
My daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time .
I 'm a soccer mom so I was n't sure what I was looking for when it comes to dancewear .
The staff was very helpful and gave me exactly what I needed for my first time ballerina .
The service at Instep was great !!
I would recommend them to anyone !
Outstanding service & quality at a very affordable price !
This place is top notch and highly affordable !
I would recommend it hands down and am a loyal customer .
I 've also sent over a number of friends to use the services here and everyone is extraordinarily pleased !
Thanks for doing such great work on my important pieces of clothing that always look great !
Tried Crust on Broad on 3 occasions .
Twice for dinner and once for lunch Absolutely rude service every time !
The staff will not even answer the phone for take out .
Tonight , I called several times with no answer ( Btwn 5:30 and 6 pm ) and finally drove there to place my order in person .
There was not a customer to be found .
we purchased a new home but was unable to sell our old house so we contacted this property management company and they have helped us quickly rent out our house and keep it maintained .
Since then we have decided to have them manage our other investment properties as well as we getting older and can no longer perform all the inquires .
Great help !
We just got our sunroom built by Patio World and can say that I 'm extremely happy with the whole thing .
From the amount of time spent with us to explain things during the initial quote , to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself .
I have nothing bad to say .
Very glad that we went with them .
No Customer Service
Employees seemed to be having a good time chatting and laughing with each other , while myself and other customers were completely ignored .
Another person in the store stood there with an item and repeatedly tried to get a sales person s attention .
It was n't until he gave up and walked out the door that someone asked Can I help you .
do NOT bring your car here
I got a coupon from Pennysaver for this station .
Yes , they accepted it .
However , during the test , they did whatever they can to get my test failed .
Then , they sold me overpriced stuffs , such as oil tank cap , so that my car can pass it right away .
I ended up paying much more .
Are you kidding me ?
I do n't get it .
Spongy and sweet bread ( microwaved ? ) , heartless salsa , tiny dogs ...
You order at the counter and there is a space for tip on your credit card receipt .
The dude who grills the retarded dogs is rude .
If this is the best that Tucson has to offer , I am out ta here ...
I called on a Friday at 12:30 complaining of a severe toothache .
Dr. Obina told me that his office closed at noon and that I should call him on Monday .
I had been a patient of Dr. Olbina for 9 years and had spent thousands of dollars on crowns etc .
There are plenty of good dentists in Fernandina .
Do n't go to Amelia Gentle Dentistry .
Good location
For a hotel like this you would expect some form of free internet .
What you get is a $ 13 / day charge to access the internet through a slow 512 / 512 kb / s that you can only use to check email etc ( Read : No downloading ) .
Other than that the hotel is in a good location and the breakfast is great
Make You Feel Like a Number
Stay away from Kids First West Chester .
You NEVER get a human on the phone .
It 's impossible to get an appointment .
If you get caught in traffic and are a couple minutes late they make you re-schedule ... for 6 weeks later .
And worst of all your child feels like a number not a patient .
Go somewhere else .
Rcommended by bees , too !
Highly recommended .
Joe removed a wasp nest for our condominium building and we appreciated the environmentally friendly method and prompt , friendly and informative service .
No spraying of pesticides !
Very professional .
Reasonable rate .
We highly recommend Joe and his wasp removal service to individual home owners and condos .
He knows his bees !
Suzanne , Vancouver
Very Accomodating
We were in Springfield , IL for a family funeral from Kansas City .
We arrived early and the staff was very accomodating to our families and the situation we were in .
The rooms were very clean , including the microwave and refrigerator .
This is a nice place , and I know we will return to meet my sister - in - law from Chicago !!
GREAT SERVICE AND PEOPLE !!
Deb Watson is the contact person and she and the rest of the staff were great !!!
She continues to help me when needed even if I have a service question .
Since I 'm usually at work late Deb has stayed around to help me out when needed .
This was after I brought the car !!!! !
Service does not get any better !!!!
Hidden Gem in Alpharetta
This French born , French trained chef and his creative partners offer a taste fresh , locally sourced , fabulously prepared food in the most unlikely of locations .
Try their weekend " tastings " which you can learn about by getting on their weekly email list .
It 's the best meal for the money you will find in all of metro Atlanta .
Le petit is the best place to get your nails done !
It is very clean , staff is friendly , and I have never waited !
I go every other week for the shallac / gel manicure which is only $ 25 and it truly lasts 2 weeks !
I love it .
Pedicures are also great .
Try this place out !
I promise you will not be disappointed !
Amazing Pictures at an Amazing Price
Rendy is totally amazing .
She gave me amazing pictures at an amazing price and made my wedding day so memorable .
She was way easy to work with and made my wedding day so easy and she got some amazing pictures , not only of me , but of my family and friends .
She is amazing .
I would recommend her to anyone !
So very delicious !
Excellent !
November 7 , 2010 First time eating at Caffe Bella Italia and it was a wonderful experience .
From the delectable Antipasto Misto to the Spaghetti alla Barese and the Parmigiana and ending with gelato , all was mouth watering .
Too bad they were out of the Chocolate Lava Cake .
Maybe next time they will have it .
Service was excellent !
Sandy
Beware of Sharayu
Hopless service , at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised .
Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint .
My advise to all is I have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you do nt !!!
Course has come a long way !!
HCC 's new nine was a little shaky at first , but the NEW grounds superintendant has done wonders for the course !!
The comment below definitely needs to be retracted !
Come back and give HCC a second chance at least !
It is a great course for local golfers to be proud of and all the comments in 2008 have been very positive !!
Excellent Physiotherapists !
Kusal Goonewardena and his team of Physios are unbelievable !
I have been suffering from back pain for over 12 years and have been to numerous specialists , physios , osteos and chiros with no help .
It took the Vigor team only 4 visits to get me feeling normal !
And now 2 months after my last appointment I am better than ever .
Thanks guys !
They must have read these reviews and improved !
My husband and I happened in on a whim .
We sat in the front dining area , it was very cozy and pleasant .
Our server was quite attentive and the food was fantastic .
My husband has been a professional chef , so he is a good judge of quality food .
This was a flavorful , enjoyable meal for both of us .
Rude Rude Rude
went in there and got my dog groomed came home to an uneven dog then took him back to get evened up what a mistake !
she did nt even let me finish a sentence without insulting me and telling me how i should have said it !
i wo nt go back !
she needs to develop a personality !
brought dog home and it s all choppy now !
It 's helpful to know a quite a bit about bull fighting .
If you watch a lot of fights ( youtube ) and research some of the history ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting ) you will find yourself enjoying it a lot more !
Also after seeing a handful of bullfights , I can say that they 're a lot more enjoyable if you 're smashed ( BAC >= .15 ) .
All I can say is that I am glad I went in !
The nurses are sweet as pie and the doctor is wonderful .
This place is about healing , not making a buck .
The followup visit is FREE !!
After going to the hospital and paying ER prices ... there is no way I wo n't be back here !!
I will be back and telling EVERYONE about this clinic .
THANK YOU !!
I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted ( a reball ) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price .
Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty .
It was a no brainer really .
I choose Console Pros and I 'm happy I did .
This place is bad .
It 's dark , dingy & dirty .
The salads are limp and the rest of the food is n't any better ( ok , the nachos are not too bad ! )
This place may have been something sometime ; but it way past it " sell by date " .
I have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and can not recommend it .
Top range of bike , cheap prices , excellent a +++
yep they fixeded my thumpstar in 1 day .
it wase nt going an had a gear box problem ....
i cold n't find anywere else local to fix it so i took it there and they fixed it for $ 150 ...
thanks guys goes really well and thaks 4 the cheap price ..
excellent , top guys a +++++ reccommend to anyone !!!!!!!!!!
Ham s on Friendly ... RIP
This is the original Ham 's restaurant , expanded into a regional chain in the late 80's -- but this one is no more .
Victim of hard times and I suspect failing corporate management .
According to news accounts , the company is struggling .
I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago .
So long Ham s ... you will be missed .
We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window .
Our window panes were so dirty that they needed a specialist to come and clean them .
We called few companies before we decide to hire them .
They came on time and completed their work quickly .
We were very happy how clean looked our windows .
If you have some problems with your windows , you should call them .
Great help even near closing time !
I came in to town for a week and forgot my trainers !
Oh no !!
I came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful .
They spent a lot of time with me and got me into a great pair of shoes .
I think they may even be better than the pair I have been using this past year !
Thanks Run on !
Great
This is a perfect place to get your hair done .
I have gone there time and time again whenever I need to get my hair done or when I want a haircut .
When I get my hair done there , they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair .
The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
Highly Recommend
I have worked with Shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed .
No matter what state I am in when I arrive , I always leave feeling better .
She has not only helped me through some challenging computer - work and sports related injuries , she was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond .
I highly recommend her .
Best Store In Boothbay Harbor
What a fantastic store , I love this place .
Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have .
Their items are very unique , great quality , great prices .
They also have the best tea I ever had , not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores , I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter .
The BEST
Dr. Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters .
Dr. Aster is very kind an gentle with the children , but also positive and to the point with the parents .
She is and excellent doctor to have on one 's team .
Even though I live pretty far from her office I still make the trip so my daughters will have the BEST !
My wife and I avoided doing some fairly simple electrical re-wiring in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved .
I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable .
He was prompt , knowledgable , friendly , clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business .
I will reccommend his services however / whenever possible !
Real pros
I 've had writer friends describe horror stories with their printers .
I tell them : why not just go with these guys ?
Richard Joule and the gang are pros from start to finish .
They set out to exceed your expectations .
Already I 'm considering future projects , and I can assure you that for my printing needs I will be choosing no other than Atlanta Paperback Book Printing .
I have been here 3 times and all 3 times it has been bad !
They have messed up my order and .... The food was just not good !
I had sonic in many other palces but for some reason this sonic is always just covered in grease and not good ... :(
I hope they get there act together ...
I am going to give it one last chance in next few months and see ??
I called them for an estimate and they INSULTED ME WHEN I ASK THEM QUESTIONS .
THEY ARE VERY RUDE AND NASTY .
PLEASE DO N'T USE THIS MOVING COMPANY IF YOU DO N'T WANT TO : CRY , HAVE TROUBLE AND A BAD EXPERIENCE ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE .
THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LOW PRICE OVER THE PHONE AND ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE THEY WILL CHANGE THE PRICE , I GUARANTEE IT .
You 've Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home .
I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks !
Satisfactory for sure with the sercvice !
Beats having one " cleaning lady " who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the " maids " did !
This place has the best baby and children s clothes .
Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just ca nt find in a lot of stores .
It is all very unique and you wo nt find any other baby wearing the same stuff .
I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess .
After all she will only be a baby for so long I figure why not enjoy it .
Antique Lighting , Fixtures , Chicago
Great place for Antique Lighting !
I visited their huge Chicago lighting showroom and all I have to say is WOW !!
Lots of collections , many antique light fixtures , Chandeliers , custom lighting etc .
I think they have the largest collection for Chandeliers Chicago .
Antiques , Vintage , Contemporary & Modern Chandeliers .
I would recommend them for any custom lighting or Lighting Repair and Restoration Chicago
Great Food Awesome food Awesome service
I wanted to try someplace new again .
This place rocked .
Brought my wife Deb with me and she like the Fried Crab Wontons and said they were good ..
We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs .. good also .
I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great ..
I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome ... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars .
DO NOT GO HERE !!!
I went to get my nails filled Friday , by Monday 2 were broken .
I was not happy with the way they looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a dip in the center of each nail .
I also had a pedicure , and they cut my nails too short , one of my big toes looks like it s getting infected .
No way .
I 'm certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but I wanted to try the real things here at A Dong .
Cold , slimy , tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods .
Not good , not great , and again another disappointment in Central Iowa .
How do these places stay in business .
This town needs some food soul and this is not it .
Worth Every Penny
My girlfriend and I ate at The Grill last night , and our experience was amazing .
Everything we ordered was prepared to perfection , and was presented perfectly .
The asparagus , seared tuna , and lobster tail were the best we ever had .
Then the desserts came , and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had .
I will sum it up with , it was worth every penny !
BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER !!!
It was the best Chinese food I have ever had .
All the food tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , it is awesome .
The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly .
Every time I go , Kevin , the manager , will always remember my family and I .
Overall , it is very family oriented , and I recommend it to everyone !!!
Furnace repair
Tiger Heating is awesome .
I had John and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced .
These guys were absolutely professional .
John was here in 45 minutes after I called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning .
If you need someone to help you out with your heating problems , I DEFINITELY would call TIGER HEATING and AIR .
Absolutely a wonderful company .
My family and I thank you !!!!!!!!!!
They Suck
Go somewhere else ...
Wanted to buy a Rhino 700 and a Grizzly 700 .
After searching high and low for a salesman , I was treated like dirt , and we left .
Parts department blows , Service department is even worse .
I live 10 minutes from Cycle City , but I Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange , dealt with the owner , Levi , and was well taken care of .
Professional and inspiring
Nigel from Nidd Design has always provided a first class service , from his advice and professionalism to the quality of his design drawings and planning applications .
His knowledge and expertise help smooth the way with any planning application , ensuring compliance with the building regulations .
Once you have met Nigel you will not want to work with anyone else .
He really does turn your dreams into reality for your home !
We came at around 730 and they close at 8 and wanted to try the specials but they were out for the day so I would say go way before they close .
Got the crab rangoon which was great , tofu with cabbage which was spicy but good and shrimp satay which was also good .
Def going to come back and try this place again .
Bea was really nice and asked how the food was .
Cute place also
As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food .
However , I still like this place a lot .
Esp. the mole , tortilla soup , and guacamole .
Margaritas are alright .
My only complaint is the QUESO .
It used to be fabulous , why did you guys change it ??
Queso should not be watery :( .....
*** update *** NEVER MIND !
They fixed the queso !
Thank you thank you
There are so many wonderful great places to dine in houston .... do n't . waste your time here .
I had the morelias enchiladas .
The sauce was dry and the enchiladas did not taste good . at all .
In fact my friend vomited after our meal .
Maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor .
Service was okay not great , we came for a late lunch .
I do n't recommend this place .
Skylight repair
My skylight was making a horrible noise when the wind blew .
James Bateman came the day I called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently .
He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention .
He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction .
When the next hailstorm blows through , I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction .
tricky short guy
The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement .
To my surprise $ 20 deposit .... New movies not on shelf .. under the counter for Telugu Speaking people only ... or people who spend $ 30 or more groceries ..
That did it for me .. no more Raina 's .
Besides parking is a pain .. cramped and un-ruly with Kumon Parents next door .... gives me heebee gee bees'
Small Firm with Great Service
Bloom Legal was really attentive to my problem , and Seth Bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue I was dealing with .
I much preferred the one - on - one service here to the experiences I 've had with bigger offices and firms .
While I hope I do n't have any need for a lawyer anytime soon , if I do I 'll definitely use this firm again .
Used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism ( received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details ) and the subsequent delivery of my gift ( To Split , Croatia ) was as requested .
The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard .
Would highly recommend to anyone requiring overseas gift delivery .

I LOVE MY GYM !
FITNESS UNLIMITED is a second home to a lot of us gym members who work out daily .
If you are serious about working out in a non-commercial like atmosphere then you have chosen the best place to be .
This is the most humble gym you will every step into .... if you dare to work on your body do n't be surprised when you see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be !!
Over-rated ...
This restaurant is over-rated .
It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
The service is poor ...
I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it .!
Secondly , the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like Hormel 's chili .. the cheese was American cheese !
The Chili Relleno .. had no batter on it .
I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17 .
Mixed Tempura ..................... 8.25 Shrimp or vegetable tempura & salad .
I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size , to go box set up and quality of the food for the price .
I 'm very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again .
Learn from a Cesar Gracie black belt and former ufc fighter !
When i say jiu - jitsu or mma i mean it !
Best jiu - jitsu mma in Santa Rosa and i have the experience and belt to back it up !
When you come to ncfa you will see a real instructor that teaches and trains everyday !
If your coach has no fights and you never see him train and sweat something is wrong !

Good Pizza at a good price
I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places , this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it .
The pizza is usually pretty good , the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more , but it was still good .
Their BBQ chicken pizza is one of the better ones I have ever had .
HORRIBLE SERVICE !!!
Absolute horrible service from the parts department .
They are very rude over the phone and in person .
They talk down to you like they are supreme beings , if you hate your job so much then quit !!
How these guys can get away with being so rude with people is mind blowing .
I will NEVER do business with Sun Toyota again .
Thank god there are plenty of Toyota dealerships to choose from in this city .
this is a good place
I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great .
They had a great selection of colors to choose from and their seats are super comfty .
I enjoy going there although i 've only been there once , i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here .
i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality .
Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people , and the minute you steep into their school , the calm loving atmosphere takes over , and tension and worries stay outside in the street , whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice .
A wonderful place , if you want more than just the physical side of yoga .
Give yourself the gift of trying this place , to see if it fits you ...
They do n't seem to be interested in selling cars .
Went there yesterday : we are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so we wanted to test - drive both back to back .
The salesperson refused !
Claimed he was too busy for two test drives .
We were the only customers there !
Do n't waste time , just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek , they actually do try to help their customers there !
ATE HERE A COUPLE TIMES .
IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE , MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI .
SO , IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES , WELL , IT IS OK .
IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD .
IF YOU WANT A STEAK , WELL , THIS IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY .
OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK , THIS IS NOT IT .
Eulogic
Good place to be on a Sunday Night .
The beers were good , nice choice of beers as well , and as usual the mussels were great , the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs .
Filled up on too much beer and hence can not comment on the food .
But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern .
If you are a handcraft beer person , this is a fantastic place to be .
Perfect Location plus
I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it 's been a refreshing change .
I used to live at Meadowrun and that was a nightmare .
The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I 'm a bit surprised by other comments .
She 's very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests .
Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit .
great service / deals - support this local business
I have used these guys for new snows , fixing lots of flats , used replacement tires , and oil changes .
They have the best prices locally and good customer service .
One guy is a little surley , but who gives a crap as long as your car 's work is outstanding .
AND they 're usually able to help you as a walk - in , and they 're fast .
Overall - good stuff .
Another great business bites the dust !
The best cakes EVER !
A bit pricey , so I did n't go very often , but it was always a treat when I did .
The prices were worth what I got .
I 'm assuming they are completely out of business since I ca n't find any contact information .
I 'm hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer .
Super nice people , really good food
What I love most about this place , other than the food , is that eating here makes you feel like you 're in a small town rather than Baltimore .
The owners are really nice , they serve good food at a good price , and the option to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic ) is great .
One of my top 5 places to eat in Baltimore .
Overpriced
This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they are owned / operated by the same people .
The food is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality .
Do n't even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there .
I have ate here 3 times since they first opened , and the service has been poor each time , the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow .
Apps 4 Salad 3 Entree 3.5 Wine 5 ( NOV 07 )
Enjoyed this cozy little spot with a group of 8 folks .
Service was excellent .
Food was excellent .
Wine was excellent .
I was feeling the need for some fish so I had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if I am in town again , I 'll definitely order a steak .
A perfect place for a romantic dinner .
Lots of " pretty people " dining inside .
Great staff .
Very helpful !!!!
They interviewed me , gave me tests in the software I included on my resume , and placed me in a position that I kept for several years .
Re-interviewed and am going on interviews for a new job .
I 'm really thankful for the folks at HR Office .
They are dependable , have great connections in the community , and are a great resource for finding a job .
I highly recommend them to all of my friends !!!! !
Great experience - consider checking out their puppies before buying from a breeder !
I adopted a 3.5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
The staff was very helpful in finding the right dog for me and the care my pup received was outstanding .
If you are on the lookout for a pure breed pup do n't forget to check out the shelters !
My pup has a wonderful temperment and has been a wonderful addition to my family !
Food good , service poor
No silverware , asked for a spoon for my son s mac and cheese ended up having to use my tea spoon .
Asked for bar - b - que sauce never got it .
Never checked back with us once we got our food .
Had to go the the bus boy s station ourselves to get napkins .
Only one server , too buys talking with others I guess .
Food was good , but service means a lot to me .
Dr. Chao you are the best dentist I have ever had .
You are knowledgeable , professional , gentel and kind .
I wish I had you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now , However I am glad you are my dentist now .
Even though you are expensive .
Thank you for helping to preserve my teeth .
You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile .
Con Garage
I brought my car in for a simple emissions test .
I guess they figured me for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my car would n't pass unless I replaced a hose .
Ten minutes later , I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors .
If you 're a fan of herpes , being ripped off , and child molesters , this is the garage for you .
If not , go somewhere else .
Rude service
even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude .
I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me , or even just give me an approximate price range .
He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price .
What kind of rude service is that ?
I do n't want to waste my time with them .
Top notch eats !
So here we are in Manson .
Manson ?
Yes , Manson .
Right near Chelan .
Aka Nowheresville .
And this litttle gem of a 7 - table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise .
A short but wide - ranging menu executed with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street .
Fantastic food served without pretense , very reasonably priced wine selections .
A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting .
Excellent Service and Reasonable Prices
Boutique stores dealing in children 's clothing / gifts are often outrageously priced ( who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie ? )
but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose 's prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ) .
The service was also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without being overbearing .
Will definitely return .
Consistantly poor
A lack of organisation , coupled with the distain for its customers , makes this the worst rental agency I have used .
Chasing them on issues from the day I moved in ( many of them still unresolved as I left ) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds , after I left . . . . as soon as I could .
If you must use them , be vigilant and be ready to push , if you can go elsewhere then I would .
AMAZING NIGHT - Great Party Spot !!
Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks ... place is awesome .
Had to keep in mind that the A / C broke , I feel bad it was their opening !
Anyway , once that is fixed , this place will be amazing .
Drinks were awesome , prices reasonable , and staff friendly .
This is an awesome date spot that the area SERIOUSLY needs .
Check out The Willow Lounge , you ll be happy !
It s been a few years since I have been to Ipanema .
But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food ( think lots of meat ) , but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant !
And , I can say , this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond .
Amazing !
Do n't let the nondescript building entrance fool you , these are some creative and talented chefs ... two thumbs way , way up !
Excellent food , fantastic wait staff
I recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser 's .
We had 30 guests for the event , and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well .
The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless .
I highly recommend Fraiser 's for anyone planning a special event for friends , family or business .
FANTASTIC STORE !!!
I came upon this store as the building caught my eye .
It 's located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway .
The store was decorated with furnishings & accessories .
The friendly crew working was great & very helpful .
This store is what Colorado is all about .
Also , I purchased some furniture last year and all has been great !
It's durability & look was perfect and I will definitely be adding to my collection soon !
Lovely People , Great Hats
I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service .
It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people .
We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act .
I recommend them highly !
DO NT ever go there , not even if your car flips .
Their service sucks to start off with , people are cruel and ignorant .
I 'm compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products .
They DO NOT have a return policy and even if their product SUCKS , they will NOT take it back !
DO NOT EVER GO HERE .
I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people .
And they THRIVE to get a customer .
DO NOT go here .. thank you
Horrible
I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off .
I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1.5 in the back .
My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous .
This woman should be working in supercuts ... if that .
This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that .
Do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment .
The worst Burger King restaurant !!!
I generally like the BK over the other fast serving restaurants ; however , I regreted to visit this restaurant at my town .
This is a shame of my adorable town , Branford .
I ordered a kid meal with a milk and found a bottle was half opened already .
I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay .
Disgusting french fries is very best menu .
Do n't go , or you will learn how to waste your money .
Disappointed
The Bad : I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists .
I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed .
If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were .
Highly Recommended
We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff .
The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal .
Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in .
We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it 's worth the extra travel , as the care provided exceeds our expectations ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere .
HORRIBLE !!!! !
This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering .
The crust was lopsided , thicker on one side than the other .
It actually had a hole in one of the slices .
There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
I know New York pizza and this is not it !!
This was nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment !!
I would not suggest this pizza to anyone !!!
best quote ever My gate was stuck halfway open so I called A CLASS Garage Doors Dr Services .
They came to my house in no time and started working on the gate .
They were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it .
Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever .
I know that if my garage door needs to be repaired , I will be calling A CLASS Garage Doors
You will be happy at this store !
Allen Tire was recommended by friend after my having bad tire experiences in Temecula .
The store manager , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus .
Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
The store is clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in .
They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right .
Easiest Time I ever had purchasing a car !
Excellent service , Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch .
Very kind and reliable .
I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service .
I have since purchased two cars from this dealership , The first one was from Phillip and the second was from Richard .
Both were excellent sales men who put my needs first .
This place has done a great job of taking care of the usual maintenance on my hooptie .
I also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker ... and never get the usual excuses other shops always gave me ... " the inspection guy is n't here today " .... for example .
Today I went into Kwik Kar and there were two cars in front of me for inspection ... but I was still out of there pretty quick ... barely had time to read a chapter in my book .
Extremely helpful and professional
As first - time home buyers , my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty , extremely helpful .
She worked with us for over a year , helping us find our perfect home .
Stephanie 's knowledge of the market and properties in our price range , made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did .
We would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone looking for a home in the Yampa Valley .
We appreciated her patience , knowledge and kindness !
Great Barber
Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick 's , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail .
I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right .
Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par , but if you wait for Nick ... you 'll be good .
UGH !!!
Got some nice " freshly baked " fruit squares , a personal favorite of mine .
Took a bite , it tasted odd .
Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold !!!!
Ugh !!
I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
She also refused to get a manager .
I left my number , or tried to anyway .
Same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number .
I 'll never go back there again
For cheap Chinese food , this is the place to go .
I used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy , MO - nothing terrible but not that great .
Now , I wo n't eat fast food Chinese unless it 's from this place .
The best value I 've found from a Chinese restaurant .
I do n't live in Lake St. Louis anymore , but deliveries were always correct and the service courteous .
Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin' : sad face :
Amazing Experience !
My experience was amazing at Providence Aesthetics and Medical Spa .
Jana Kueck was nothing but professional .
She makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world .
Jana made me feel very comfortable .
Provided me with warm blanket and has soft music playing .
Walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed .
Equipment is state of the art .
I would reccomend anyone to go see Jana Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer .
Dave is a patient and methodical teacher , who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students ' passion and the direction they want their lessons to take .
Also , he loves teaching so much , his price is unbeatable , but that does not change his level of skill .
Dave has much to offer .
In just 2 - 3 focused lessons , I 'm already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence !
~ Jason
We love our new roof !
We would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home .
Everything was done on a timely manner and things were cleaned and picked up every day when the crew was done .
We also liked the way that Ray checked on the job every day .
And when the job was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day .
We would not hesitate to use Spears Roofing again .
We have already recommended you to some of our friends !
OMFG
I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE EVERY TIME i GO THIS HOT CHICK SHOWS UP AND i MEAN REALLY HOT BUT SHE IS LIKE REAAAALLY DUMB AND THEN THEIR IS THIS OTHER CHICK THAT IS REALY UGLY BUT SHE IS LIKE SUPER SMART SHE COULD BE A SCIENTIST , BUT THEN THEIR IS THIS STONER WHO ALWAYS COMES HERE HIGH AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS HIS FUCKING DOG WHO IS SO HIGH FROM THE SECOND HAND SMOKE I THINK HE IS TRYING TO TALK .
ANYWAY WE DRIVE AROUND IN MY VAN AND SOLVE MYSTERYS AND SHIT
AMAZINGLY YUMMY !
I just got back from france yesterday and just missed the food already !
My sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town , I was so excited I just wanted to go and test it out for my self !
Their customer service was perfect !
Their Food was better then anything I had ever tasted .
EVEN IN FRANCE !
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great atmosphere , amazing food , and great customer service !
Thank you Roll UP Crepes !
This is one of the worst places I have stayed , we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry .
Even though they still charge you the days you booked but wo n't use , it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager .
Bad service starting from the front desk .
The best person is the valet .
Short of that , avoid this place , as a silver Marriott member , this is a disgrace .
BEST PLACE IN AMES
I lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower :) The places are very nice and clean , and in great condition !
I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful .
The fitness center was GREAT !
The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin , sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations .
I would recommend these apartments to anybody !
I absolutely LOVED living there .
The Best Service Ever !!
I have never had better service .
My car broke down and roadside towed my vehicle to Sussman Kia .
They squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time .
Everyone was pleasant and very helpful .
The service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished .
The advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle .
I give this dealer an A + !
I will definitely be bringing my car back for service .
HEAVEN ON EARTHHHHHHH !!!!
MUST TRY !!!
A +++
THIS PLACE IS THE BEST .
I HATED SUSHI BEFORE BUT NOW I CA NT STOP EATTING IT !!!!!!!
NICE SERVICE , AND EXCELLENT FOOD .
EVERYTHING IN HERE SEEMS TO AMAZE ME !!!
THEIR GRILL DISHES ARE OUT TA THIS WORLD AND SUSHI IS JUST FABULOUS !!!!
I EAT HERE AT LEAST 5 DAYS A WEEK .
THEY HAVE EXCELLENT SUSHI CHEF SPECIAL ROLLS FOR A FAIR PRICE AND SO IS THE GRILL ORDERS .
A ++++ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
JUNO AND OPEN I LOVE YOU GUYS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[ no homo ] :D
friendly , fine food
The one - star review from 2005 is out of date .
There was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly .
The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches , homemade soups , fresh salads .
The atmosphere may not be for everyone .
It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ) , but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
Love the soups .
The New Italian Kid on the Block
Another Italian restaurant in Collingswood ?
Do we need another one ?
Only if it is of the quality of That 's Amore .
The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
The arancini di riso ( risotto fritters ) are not to be missed .
Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there 's the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven .
Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I 'm planning on ordered a few instead of an entree .
Auto Towing is one of the best towing services I have used .
The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed .
The auto mechanics that work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question I had .
They have towed car for me a few times and I am always very satisfied with this services .
If you are looking for towing services that can offer you a good towed car service , then Auto Towing is the company for you .
A very satisfied new customer !
As a very satisfied new customer , I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning .
They are professional , knowledgeable , and take meticulous care and pride in accomplishing their work .
Not only were my wife and I very pleased , but I also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use , before and after United Air Duct performed their work .
Based on the test results , the home inspector stated that the quality of their job was ??? excellent ??? .
The Best Breakfast in Solana Beach !
We love T 's Cafe !
Without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody mary and some eggs benedict .
T 's has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason .
Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home - cooked with style .
I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
If you 've been to North County , chances are it 's in your favorites list already .
Prominent Builders NJ
Prominent Builders in New Jersey are one the best building contractors , I was referred to them by my friend , I am so glad I used them for my Home renovation , and addition .
They were very professional , respectful , completed the Job on time , and well below my budget .
Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
Great Dude Cut !
Great service , cool vibe , impeccable style .
I 'm a guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job # 1 .
After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda .
Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave ... saying it 's the best look I 've ever had .
Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius .
Looks like there 's a lot of talent in this place .
Worth every penny .
My Favorite place at Wildwood
I have been going to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first .
I rated it 5 stars .
I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood , this hotel has everything that we are looking for .
It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
When in Scordia , Sicily
If ever in Sicily please take the time to visit Anna Maria Jose Mudo and her familia .
They are and always will be the nicest people in Sicily that you will meet .
You will also have the pleasure of learning the Italiano language .
You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture , that I have fallen in luv with .
I will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years .
Luv always ..
I 've never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before , but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels ( whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs ) I would now not recommend this business to anybody .
If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired !
Nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives !
Best Car Dealer in TX
I purchased a nissan from this dealship .
The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at .
They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork .
The paperwork was a very easy and smooth .
They tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it wo n't hurt my score .
Overall , I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase .
If you 're looking to buy a car , definitely give them a call .
They have a huge inventory .
I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great .
I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
Yes , we had to wait , but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first .
Any ER would be the same .
As far as being treated like a drug seeker , that has not been my experience .
As a nurse I know about drug seekers .
This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system .
Wonderful Experience
I had immense pain on a Sunday morning , with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday .
Dr. Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take care of me .
He was incredibly informative about the options I had , giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from .
Coming from a person who hates the dentist in general , Dr. Taylor was the best !
He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
I would recommend him to everyone !
HORRIBLE
This school is the worst one i 've ever been to .
I attended it for 2 years , and that was enough .
There 's holes everywhere in the ceiling , sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling , and the whole condition of the school is horrible .
The staff and the Principal are rediculous , they do n't listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks , because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student 's ) .
The education is horrible at best , do society a favor , and do NOT send your student here .
Excellent customer service and quality work .
They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots -- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels .
That was 4 years ago .
I have n't been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
( I 've been through at least 5 places already . )
If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week , I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again .
So Handy for Local La Jolla Stuff - Especially for Finding Residential Numbers
Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village , I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers .
The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook .
It 's really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
THX :-)
The staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if you r looking fot a good game and are n't a nerd , do nt ask them .
The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps .
I knew what it was and told the guy that it was n't a fps .
He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue .
Overall they are n't very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
First and Last time we 'll eat there
My friend and I went there for lunch today .
Neither one of us had ever been - so we thought we 'd try it .
BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold .
We both kept trying to find something we liked .
The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
Would NOT recommend this place to anyone - in fact - save your money and go somewhere else .
Liquidweb.com Rocks !!!
I am not a client of liquidweb.com , but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites .
I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb .
As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not , and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting .
The kind of support they provide is simply great !!!
I would like to host my upcoming website to Liquidweb.com

simple but perfect
IF you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes , this is not the place for you .
If you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients , you 'll love Vetri .
Hands - down the best pasta and gnocchi I 've ever eaten ( and I 've eaten a lot ) .
The antipasti were amazing , the wines were mind - blowing , the service could n't have been better .
I 've dined at lots of high - end restaurants and I 've never before felt my money was so well spent .
Great Prices , Great service !
I 've been to this shop twice ( once for an inspection and again for an oil change ) and they truly live up to their name : Discount !
They have all kind of coupons available for car washes , oil changes , state inspection , etc .
The thing is , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates !
There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you 'd like .
The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers .
Top notch , all the way !
David is amazing
David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used .
He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation .
He was patient and adapted when everything did n't go according to schedule on my wedding day .
Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing .
He got the pictures back to me quickly .
I would highly recommend David to anyone .
He will exceed your expectations !
He does n't just take pictures he makes art out of them and you wo n't even notice that there 's a camera there .
Not so great
My husband just got a bike there as a gift he 's only had it a month .
It 's a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
But just this week a peddle broke .
He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes ??
So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price .
Which was very expensive .
He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off ??
Trek is not so great
Only Concerned With Money
I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect .
The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but I was disappointed with their customer service .
Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment , even if you had an emergency .
It 's pretty ridiculous !
They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident !!!!
They do n't care one bit about you !!!!!
Terrible service !!!
Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate .
They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
When I called the manager to complain , she said she KNEW the guy did n't know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier !
Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead .
So what was the point of the appointment !?!
To just come over and hang out ?!?
I will NEVER do business with this company !
EVER !!!
Internet Department is rude and insulting
I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email " AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS .
I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS " Wow , can you believe in today s tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles .
As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker .
Stay away from this dealership !!!
This place is a Rip - Off
I brought a car in to have the " check engine " light diagnosed back in March of 2010 .
They said it was " plugs and wires " and quoted me $ 330 to do the work , including parts .
I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way .
Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank ( 1 screw ) and the air filter canister ( 4 spring clips ) .
I did the work myself for $ 50 .
There 's no excuse for that kind of estimate .
My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we did n't want to wait in line at Outback .
What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM .
# 1 it s immaculately clean .
# 2 the decor is tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food is FANTASTIC .
This is authentic Cuban cuisine ; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly .
The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
TRY THIS PLACE - YOU 'LL LOVE IT .
Thank you for helping me get more healthy !
I came in and saw Dr. Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking .
I have to tell you that I have n't had one and do n't want one .
It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too .
I sent a customer of mine to you .
Dr. Ruona , if you read this , thank you for helping me get more healthy .
I feel lighter and feel that I have more possibilities open to me now than I did before .
I ca n't thank you enough .

Fantastic for kids
If you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you 'll love this zoo .
It 's only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots .
We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
The animals were all very sweet and patient with her .
Among the animals that were available to touch were pony's , camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH !!!
Wonderful , inexpensive and lots of fun !
WOW !!!
I ca n't say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee .
Gracee is more excited to see her than she excited to see me !!!!
She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls !
She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her !!!
She is caring , punctual , and very enthusiastic about her job !
You should give her a try - it 's worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
Worst Service I 've Ever Experienced
I wish there was something good to say about the business , but unfortunately , there is n't .
1 ) Service and manners were nonexistent .
2 ) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative .
( to both myself and customers ) 3 ) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business .
4 ) The business is very unorganized .
The invoice is not detailed , so it is difficult to see what you are paying for .
I 'd recommend to save your time and energy and find another greek store .
Exile is the best !!!
Exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond !
I have been shopping there for over six years now .
The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner , Mimmy , is an absolute angel .
The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe .
In addition , the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic , which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia .
Exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community .
Shop local at Exile !!
Over-rated
Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but that does n't impress me .
The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but , the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries .
The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
The angry lobster was completely over-priced !
$ 80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables !
I would n't go there again .
Alto delivers on all levels .
From the moment you enter the restaurant , you know you are some place special .
The service is impeccable , and the food is even better .
I highly recommend the four - course tasting menu , which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite .
Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9 pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee ! ) .
While it 's not cheap , Alto will give you an experience you 'll never forget .
The landlord is not nice nor helpful
I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years .
I love the location and the apartment !!
I 'm a single female and I feel safe coming home at night .
The maintenance people are AWESOME !!!!
And the exterminator is very nice , also .
Yes , you still have a few bugs , but that 's going to be anywhere you go !
The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord .
She is a pure b**** !!!
I know that 's ugly ... but she wo n't help you out for anything ... sad story .
Other than that , I would recommend living here . :)
The staff leaves a lot to be desired .
The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
A simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare .
She may be the reason for all the change .
I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice .
If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
WWW - Wonderful Wild Wildernest inn
I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five !
Atop Spring Mountain , from the decks of the West porch , " one can see forever " a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur .
I saw deer frequently , in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge .
There were occasional bears on the deck in the morning .
and most correctly , us visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife .
It would have been more than one could bear !
Kathy and Stewart , the proprietors were the epitome of perfection .
Delightful , hospitable , superb , cozy and comfortable .
I hope to be back !
junkie lube ?!
really weird place , I was driving home from work thought I 'd stop in for an oil change and well , there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze .
The neon lighting sign still said " on " yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch , more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they 'd be open tomorrow .
I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was .
WOW !
grey shirt " mark " of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someon else s clothing .....
A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here .
While there was n't too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ) , we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there .
It 's not the classiest place , but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly .
For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
Restored my faith in Mechaincs .
I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
I was about to give up when I met Jason and Neal .
They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more .
The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning .
I can not say enough about this place .
They have restored my faith in Mechanics .
Do yourself a favor , call these guys first and enjoy driving your car again ..
a great vacation !
We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more !
Excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts .
After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and I 'm sure they will do their best to be hospitable .
OMG
OMG .. make sure to book a reservation , as this magical place is packed ( in a nice way ) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food .
The waiters are like no other ...
My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75 % tip , and it was worht every penny ..
The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic ..
I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat ) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
Holly is truely the best hairstylist !
I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here .
I was very pleased with my experience here .
All of the people were friendly and welcoming .
I got highlights , haircut , and a blowdry .
She did a great job !
Holly is very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat .
My hair looks amazing , and I get compliments all the time .
I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone .
You will not be disappointed !!!!!!
Outdated but not bad
So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together .
If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair do n't let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else .
Great , and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville .
I was born and raised in Toronto , which has a huge West Indian ( Trinidadian , Jamaican , etc ) population .
So huge in fact , that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references , and Jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria .
Anyway , I was practically raised on this stuff , and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine , Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette .
All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food , is add a whole lot of pepper .
A lot .
The finest Christmas Trees i 've ever seen .
I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding .
The owners were entertaining and gracious .
I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owner s love of all animals .
This is one of the best farms I have ever been too .
I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owner s advice I invested vanguard , got myself a woman like Jerry , and became a republican .
Thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation !
Pho - nomenal !!
I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I 've always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i tried this pho place , it blew the other pho houses away !!
all of the pho places taste the same to me , so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price .
The service here is incredible compared to the other places .
the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown .
remember to bring cash since they do n't take debit or credit .
hope this helps !!
Had a horrible experience with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , she was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
I 'm not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake .
I normally do n't write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one wo n't be getting my business , nor my family 's , nor my co-workers .
It 's never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they are right .
Highly Recommend
I work as a Transformational Life Coach .
Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate .
I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well !
She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member 's suicide , coupled with elder abuse .
I found her to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
I would recommend her highly !
They wo n't have a second chance from me .
First , let me state that although I live in NYC , I am not from NYC , I do n't care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death ( so beautiful , so clean , so awesome ) .
That said , I hated this restaurant .
The service was just about as good as I 'd get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda .
Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle .
He told me " no problem , we will match the offer or do better . "
Mr. Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems .
Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world .
I urge all St. Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus !!!
Excellent customer service !!!
Great , Honest Service
I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold .
The dealer wanted $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other things .
Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $ 400 !!
I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon .
I have finally found a mechanic I trust !!
And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
Dr. Shady
Kelly hit the nail on the head .
" Dr. Shady " is a jerk .
After the way she spoke to me on my last visit , I will not be returning !!
Good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude Dr. Shady .
You have just lost mine .
The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
Dr. Shady is inexperienced and prideful .
She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else .
Beautifully written reviews Doctor , but completely UNTRUE .
Poor Experience
I did not have a good experience w / Dr. Ghassemlou .
During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I 've always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons , however , he did not adequately explain this during our session .
I learned more about this doing my own research afterward .
I think he could 've done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts .
Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful .
It 's pretty combative actually .
you 'll love it
I have had my back fused in 2 places .
I wish that I had n't done this .
With these fusions , chiropractric is n't as successful , but it still is very helpful .
Even after my fusions , my back continued to hurt , but now it does n't hurt any more .
I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery , to talk about different treatment options first with Dr. de Barros .
He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly .
You can see different treatments that a surgeon ca n't see , so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do .
Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon !!!
I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years .
I can not tell you how often I am complimented on my hair ( style AND color ) !
I regularly request Kim 's business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked " Who does your hair ... I LOVE it !!! "
Quaint , lovely , small salon with BIG personality .
I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience .
My hair has never felt this healthy , either .
I can not recommend this salon enough !!!
Thanks Cheveux !
My Favorite in McLean
My family loves coming to Endo Sushi . They are very nice , it is never crowded , and the food is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
If you can not park in the lot , then you can park in the shopping center 's garage , and walk up to Endo Sushi .
The service is fast .
Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal !
( it 's by the door , on the hostess stand )
Horrible Service !
I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5 am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gon na lock the doors right at 5:30 .
Rude , unprofessional , just jerks .
Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!
Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless .
I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again .
Superb Arrangements
I used Fancy Flowers for my late husband 's funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me .
I am so glad that I called in to see Ana , she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me .
The flowers were all that I hoped they would be , I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all .
She is so talented , the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately , it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others .
Thank you Ana I hope to see you in the future under better circumstances .
Great first experience .
I 'm 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not " old " like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to .
She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly .
She recommended products but absolutely did n't pressure me to buy .
It 's a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut .
Oh !
And students get $ 5 off , ca n't argue with that .
Smoker s Haven
Yeah , this complex is not very good .
Our bathroom fan , one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed .
Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up .
And non-smokers beware !!!
I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers !
If you do not smoke , do not move here .
Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
You can not walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
Great Sanwiches , Great Prices
I used to go here almost every day since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .
Chicken salad salad is great too .
Best of all , the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve you in 5 minutes or less .
For the quality , the prices ( $ 4 - $ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well .
Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality , but I certainly do .
This is n't a TGIF or Cafe , it s a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
Rate a church ?
Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light .
It 's a bloody church , for chrisssake !
Big , grey and imposing .
Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure .
The pastor at this church is cool , I met him after some holiday service .
He had a robe that was made back in the '60s .
God was pleased with that one !
It 's historical for Sf , so when your aunte comes for a visit , take her there .
Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth ( do n't forget to tell 'em it s really a ' pagen ' thing ! ) .
Stop by at least once or you 'll go to heck !
ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget .
me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .
i 'm a red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won .
the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
but sice we almost just slept there i ca nt give that good of a review
It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10 am to make the repair .
I enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors .
The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair .
I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors .
Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service .
Roger M. , Woodinville
I would n't send my dogs there .
I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010 .
She basically said if the children getting off the bus are n't paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
Wow , really ?
With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you 're money hungry ?
REAL CHRISTIAN OF YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whether they pay me or not , if their parents get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc. THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WAS N'T PAID .
Excellent service
I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price , but I go to the Garment District for their service .
Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that , but I find the staff more helpful than anything else .
Tiffany is fabulous !
I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
She immediately went to the back , brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot .
I did n't even buy the bag there !
Huge selection and , great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they do n't have what you need .
We were expecting a great experience , when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts .
The atmosphere was nice and very clean .
The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters .
The service was ok , our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times .
To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
We should have left then .
We orderd our meals anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadillas .
Everything was bland , completely void of any spice or flavor .
We have never had mexican food this bad , it was just simply gross .
Hopefully they spice things up or they wo nt be in business long .
I recommend La Hacienda
Might try again
Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
Do n't know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides .
Cons : * Server was n't very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time , took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating .
Half the tables and bar were empty by this point .
Other Thoughts : Will try this place again .
There must be a reason so many people like it there .
Their Club sandwich looks tasty , maybe that 'll change my mind .... and a different server .
very professional / very helpful
the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful .
i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs .
they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale .
my experience with them was great - low stress , very helpful and very personal .
after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible .
from start to finish they were top notch .
i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car .
This insurance co. Is a joke !!!
They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
if you do n't mind being robbed , cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves .
They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation .
as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
Ifa is an acronym for I m a F%#king Assh@%$e !!!
Fantastic Service !
I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires , alignment and state inspection done yesterday .
I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage .
It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires !
What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride .
Great service , great pricing and SUPER CONVENIENT !
I also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that I did not need .
Love my home at Creekside
I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months !
The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff , esp. Edwin , are just wonderful .
They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help .
Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location is surprisingly quiet .
I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety .
The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe 's , Whole Foods , and other stores .
The well - equipped , clean gym is a plus !
Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose !
I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel .
Liberty construction shows up and it 's two guys ... all I get is 100 % sales pitch " We 're the best ... we 're number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we 're great " .
Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted , all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there .
Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service .
I 'm glad I trusted my gut and did n't get sucked into doing business with them .
Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right .
Do n't waste your time or money !
I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I thought it was rubbish and overpriced .
Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round , it took us just over one hour start to finish .
If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this .
If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of ?? 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
( For some reason it will not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me ! )
Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough .
I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson .
He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free .
My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due !
In addition to the core treatment , Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well - being of his patients ??? his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient .
He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately ???
Pam Gillies
Best Salsa ( hehehe )
After my trees were cleaned up , they gave me a jar of salsa .
The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had , and he was right .
No joke !
I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
Very affordable ( do n't call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .
And the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around , you will need them .....
Dr. Mann killed our pet
Yea , Dr. Mann ai n't so great .
We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead .
We live in the sub-division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets go to Dr. Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead .
If you take him here for shots , no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again .
Oh , they also charged me for the procedure ( $ 250 ) AND had the audacity to charge me a $ 25 ' DISPOSAL ' fee .
They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee .
AVOID AT ALL COSTS .
One of the worst places
This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from .
the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she did nt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant .
Gone downhill since change in ownership
Sigh .
I used to LOVE this place .
But now that they are part of a chain , service has slipped .
I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them , they lost my car key .
Lucky I had a spare with me !
To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one .
( These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy , you ca n't just go to WalMart . )
Go to the website for coupons and join the club - you can get free parking .
However , with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility , it may be cheaper to park at BNA .
Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating .
We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked .
We were told that we could n't today because they were closing soon .
I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in .
They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone .
They refused .
Terrible communication as well .
At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it had n't .
Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure .
College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE !
Went to the school here OVER PRICED !!!!!!
You do NOT learn the things you were promised .
You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you do nt then you can graduate !
Going back after graduating you r told you get a discount on services nope you do nt .
Staff is under educated .
Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money .
Over priced for students to learn !
Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
BEWARE !
You can fool people
This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising .
They convince lots of people that they are a great store , when in fact they are a very average place at best , they are just another big box store like the others .
They offer sales that are n't really sales , mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it is n't , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on .
With higher than average prices to boot !
So do n't get taken in , keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here .
On the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare .
Never again
Do n't go here unless you want to sit , order , eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes .
You wo n't even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table .
This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting .
I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it .
Oh , and their liquor license was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas .
Plus the drinks are self service , have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee , juice or water .
Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead .
I guess you get what you pay for .
I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so we asked for a single queen bed .
We got there , and we were treated to the free " upgrade " of a room with two double beds .
Since they consider this an upgrade , they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room .
Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room .
When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English , they moved our room , but we still did not receive the single queen we had " reserved "
I was thoroughly impressed !
I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart .
I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they were n't the cheapest I found but very reasonable .
The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company's were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures .
They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over - who would have guessed that one ?
Very nice work and friendly guys too .
Best money I 've spent on remodeling ever .
I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call .
New training Centre is excellent
The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull .
The classes cover all age and skill ranges , with BALLROOM , LATIN , SEQUENCE , STREET , DISCO , LINE DANCING , BALLET , TAP & JAZZ .
We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening ....
It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership .
The night I drove back home , I found that the rear window has some leakage .
( You can hear the wind while driving on highway .
Very likely it needs a new window seal ) .
I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive .
( But this is a certified car from a dealer . )
So I brought the car back the second day .
They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing .
I walked away .
So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER .
STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE .
Perfect Practice
After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish .
Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them .
The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
My dental surgeon , Dr. Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established .
Everyone was so helpful that I can not wait to go back .....

Wonderful service for large group
I had my wedding luncheon at this BJ s restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
We were also served salad and soda .
We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
I really appreciate BJ s for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service .
wonderful
I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews .
I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut .
I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did .
I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style .
It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
It was n't completly impossible !!!!
I am definitely going back
After recently relocating to South Bend , we were looking for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for New Year s Eve dinner .
We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club .
The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor , especially for being a special NYE menu .
The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced .
After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
This was a less than impressive experience at Trio 's .
Run for the hills ... you 'll be much better off !
One night was too much .
First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other people s hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told " This is a Days Inn , not the Hilton " and the receptionist then hung up on me .
To warn you to stay away from this place just is n't enough .
There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
Grocery and Daily Needs Store
Before using FusionRetail Before installing FusionRetail store was running on a dos based software .
We were having a major problem in maintaining cash .
Being a grocery shop , maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job .
Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time .
How FusionRetail has overcome these issues ?
FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way .
Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale , purchase and returns was never easy before .
How long does it take to train new people at work ?
Billing takes 15 minutes and back office jobs takes 1 day 's training How fast your support queries get answered ?
Over telephone , immediate .
On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved .
Ca n't wait to go back !!!
This is by far the BEST B&B that we have ever stayed at !
We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at .
We could not have been more welcomed , more comfortable or more well fed .
The weekend was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff .
Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well .
We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B&B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms. Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !
We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe !
Disatisfied customer , I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors .
A&E came out , charged $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A&E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A&E does not ) .
Their quote came in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part .
Seems to me like A&E charges way more than necessary !
Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , I thought that they pre-screened their vendors for price and quality of work , obviously they do not !
Lovely Nails on Cayuga St. in Lewiston , NY
First let me start out by saying , that I have had very nice pedicures at Lovely Nails on Military Road .
I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston , as I live in Youngstown .
I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life .
There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman .
I put my foot in the water and it was cool .
He did warm it up .
He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back .
If the pedicure lasted 20 mins. , that was a stretch .
The other ladies had a similar experience , both had nail polish on a couple of toes .
None of us will be using their services again , which is a shame .
Good Service - Limited Results
Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility .
He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
The office is shared with a foot doctor and it 's very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients / doctors .
I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs .
The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles .
I know it can take a while for results and did n't expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ... )
Friendly , clean and excellent location
The staff was very helpful , and gave us good advice on day and night time activities .
Common room was comfortable and clean , very good room to read or relax . ???
A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9:30 am ; yummy fresh Parisian croissants .
Comfortable and clean beds , a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out , but we did n't mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out !
The location is really stellar !
It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again .
Just Autos Thank you !
Was fast and easy , Just had our car returned this morning , I would recommend these Mobile Mechanics for sure .
They certainly know what they are doing .
The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our car s problems , he explained the problem and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working ( he explained it better ) .
They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
Now my car s gears and brakes have never run so well ... ever it s like driving a new car .
So yes , I would n't hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs , Thank you Just Autos for your help .
I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery .
I must say , I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge , & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass !
I had a sampler of IPA , Brawler , Love Stout & ESA .
All were awesome , & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers .
After my sampler & sandwich , I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout , I must say I was impressed , with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me , I think this is better , it s less dry & smoother !
If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out !
The only negative I have abou this place is the parking !
I left with a case of BRAWLER !!!! !
Oil Change Disaster
My wife had taken her '07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
A couple days after the oil change , the engine ran rough , the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically , and the engine would whir loudly .
Turns out the engine had no oil , and when oil was put it , it would just run out of the filter .
There could have ( hopefully does n't have ) major damage to the engine .
All of this started after their oil change .
Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife 's work and towed it back to fix it .
I would not recommend this shop for anything , not even something as simple as an oil change .
Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything , and smile while doing it .
Liars , negative stars !
Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy .
The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg .
However , they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings .
I wonder if they were going down a hill !
They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles .
I brought it back with 9000 miles .
They " finished " the work and told me the car was ready .
I found out they did not even drive the car , stated they looked at it before .
They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number .
They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ) , but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms .
I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever .
Great Job
I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need .
Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding .
It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and every one one of us .
He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
I 'm sure it s not every day that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep , and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer .
Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected .
Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally .

Poor service
If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ' , you will see it here .
We signed our name in about 6:00 pm .
There were 3 names before us .
The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting .
However , we waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names .
This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant ??? no reservation , sign your name here ??? .
I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
I could not understand any his reasons .
I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you .
Instructor never showed up !
January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday 's 2 PM class " Beginning Yoga with Brittany . "
We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests .
The instructor did not show up !
We waited until 2:25 PM and then left .
There were 2 in our group , and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class .
Well , not much I can say except I 'm very disappointed with this experience .
This was our first visit to your studio .
In today 's instant world , there 's no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e-mail if she was going to be late .
As a yoga studio , I 'm sure you 're all aware that all actions generate karma ???
and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
Finest ??
Really ??
I beg to differ .
This place is marginal at best .
Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained .
I was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses .
I understand not wanting to put labels like 5.10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
I do n't want to waste my time on routes set for children , but I do n't want to take on something I ca n't handle just to strain myself to exhaustion .
Rate the routes , with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy , moderate , and hard .
Again , a great outing for the kids , a frustration for an out of town climber .
Best DJ's In Town !
Wow !
These guys were the best .
They were thorough , high class , and went above and beyond .
We never had to worry about a thing , and they led the way the whole time .
They asked us things that we would have never have thought of , and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding .
Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time !
They may look young but do n't let that fool you , as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected .
I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80's , and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960's .
So we did n't expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night .
They just really know their stuff !
NEVER fear going to the dentist again !
I 'm 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life .
By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist .
My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me !
It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment .
At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around .
I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did .
Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with .
They made me feel confident in what they would do , and treated me like a member of their own family .
I never felt pain or discomfort .
The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life .
Thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !

HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD
not only is this place too expensive for what it is , it s horrible !
In the past , I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak ( and this was the sirloin ! ) , the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side .
Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
It took over 1.5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it !
Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others , as I was the last to get my food .
I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here .
Texas Roadhouse is WAY better !!
Spay and neuter service .
I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful .
But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .
You 'd think they would do a good job but they do n't care unless they are getting paid full price .
Which is so dumb .
Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
Billing Issues ...
I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail .
My insurance company , Blue Cross / Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine .
Then I got a bill for $ 483.00 .
The doctor 's office said that payments had been " reversed " .
Blue cross has no record of aa reversal .
The office refused my requests to see what they got from BC / BS .
They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter .
I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $ 160.00 has come through .
It was an ingrown toenail .
How much could it possibly cost ?
Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
I think this office has some serious billing practice issues !
We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards , posters , etc .
We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started .
They have the best rates and GREAT customer service .
On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
They did that with no problem .
I also appreciate their honesty .
I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was .
They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect .
They recently surprised me a larger order .
I ordered 1000 postcards , we normally order 5000 or more .
Because they had room to do 5000 , they created the larger amount , and shipped them early .
I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate !
They have a customer for life in us !
sheisters
i made the mistake of buying from these thieves .
I paid 2 k cash for a truck with a blown motor .
Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and " There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck " .
Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right ?
Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home .
The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back .
From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gon na take 2,000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know it s just a piece of scrap metal ?
If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
Grimy work you guys do .
Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2 k bucks .
Best Stationery store in Bethesda
Papeluna , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just opened a few days ago .
It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell 's .
I popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks .
It 's an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
Cards , wrapping paper , paper , and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own invitations or for whatever else your custom printing needs may be .
I gave the woman I spoke with today a " You 've been yelped ! " card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna .
I ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more .
printing , printing , copies , printing , copies , printing ,
Watch out for your wallet
Watch out for your wallet !
This company is overpriced for their services .
They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise .
On a recent event quote that I had done , they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition .
The craziest part is that they are n't even based locally at the city I 'm in - they just have ' teams ' in areas through the country .
I 've spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them .
Be warned - they 'll ltake you for everything they can .
Believe me .
This is THE premier university in Virginia .
It is also the largest .
With a Pizza Hut , IHOP , 3 Starbucks , Chili s , Panera , and Chipotle on campus ALONE , VCU has some of the best eating options for students .
VCU has the # 1 art school in America , and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling .
The Rams , the VCU sports team , also made the NCAA Final 4 this year , too !
VCU also offers high - rise living for students and professors , and the historic yet fixed - up houses in the Fan are also available to students , professors , or even people wanting to live in a safe , viable community .
VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond , Canal Walk , Carytown , Stony Point , Short Pump , and the VCU Medical Center .
It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year .
The U of R is also recommended , too !
Orr 's a nightmare !
DO N'T GO !
My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who 'd arrived around 1:00 am and were drinking at the springs .
When we complained to the management ( as we were instructed to do if there were any problems ) , nothing happened !
Then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guests , asked to speak to the owner , he refused to do so .
Not only that , but he told us , via his manager , that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued , even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids .
Orr is not relaxing , it 's not a safe space , and the owner is awful .
To add insult to injury , he refused to refund our money .
Do n't go !
FHS is a good high school -- c / o 1998
I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School .
We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs , with multiple hoods and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasiums , and a well - funded music department ( I was in the guitar ensemble ) .
Now , of course , there 's a new building , with presumably better facilities .
All to the good .
For those who care , a good proportion of the my class went on to 4 - year colleges , many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News .
If I remember , students went to Dartmouth , U. Penn , Duke , BU , William and Mary , Vassar , Howard , and Carnegie Mellon , among others .
Many students went to Rutgers , including their top - ranked pharmacy program .
The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
Absolutely the best little motel on the coast !
I 've stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it 's one of the best lodging experiences I 've ever had on the coast ... and I 'm even comparing it to the big resorts I 've stayed at !
A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always been five - star .
The rooms are SO clean , the managers / owners are the nicest people , the place feels so homey , and the location and grounds are beautiful .
There 's a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street .
The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it 's kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
I honestly ca n't rave enough about this place ... it 's really a hidden gem worth checking out !
My favorite cuban cafe in Orlando
I have been eating Cuban for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
I love Cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways I found this place and ca n't stop going there , I stop in at least once a week and anytime I 'm in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack .
The place is chill and comfortable .
They do n't speak the best English but enough to get by .
They bake bread fresh daily , they do n't press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains .
And their breakfast is awesome !!
I can not describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
Stop in and have a bite you wo n't regret it .
A slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth !
highly recommended .
I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone .
I 've read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctor s office there is sometimes a wait ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance ) ...
I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration .
I ca nt speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you .
I personally have had wonderful service and if you re truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner Family is the place for you .
Not what i expected !
We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it did nt turn out that way !
~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders took a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape's or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyone s attention .
Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely .
On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it ....
Would n't go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper .
Nice selection , very clean , friendly staff !
Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family .
Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook .
The staff are very friendly and conscientious .
They always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ) , they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook .
They do n't just dump your ingredients on and cook either , but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush .
The selection of meats , veggies and sauces is awesome too !
Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting .
Meats are kept VERY cold , seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean .
Prices are reasonable , ( Kid s meals are around 4.99 ) and Wednesday's they have discount dinner prices , I believe .
Great Cookies , Cakes , and Customer Service
It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre-made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentine s and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting was n't overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
Although I 'll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I 'll gladly do it knowing that since she 's been astounding to me once before that she 'll always be that way !
( Also she has a really great website !
And we bought a few cookies there too , they were fantastic as well ! )
She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
Food Craving Gone and Weight Loss at Acupuncture Doctor
I am a college student .
Before treatment , my food cravings were " out of control " which caused me to be stressed out .
I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving ( about 50 % ) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment loss 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment .
I was amazed .
I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99 % gone after only 3 treatments .
Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend 's aunt recommended it .
It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain .
What I like most about Dr. Liau is that she is very caring .
She talks to you at each appointment .
I can tell she really cares and wants to help .
I am SO GLAD to have found Dr. Liau .
Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer .
An Asset to Richmond
For a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex .
Bowtie has filled that role nicely .
The theatre is in an old brick warehouse , which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium .
The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there .
The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood .
There 's plenty of parking , and I 've never had an issue with audience members who wo n't stop talking or answering their cellphones .
Best of all , there are no ads !!!! !
Just previews and the main feature .
Expect to pay full price , and the theatres themselves are on the small side .
But if you like going to the movies , you should love Bowtie .
The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card .
A great cinema in a great location .
Thank you , Bowtie !
Craft Wonderland with History
My first visit was so fun yesterday .
I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things .
I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too .
I bought a beginner s quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts .
The owner , Jean , has been there 31 years !
What a history .
She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter .
By the way , Salmagundi ( the store name ) means something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mixed bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kinds of things .
Great name for a great store !
Shop Local !

the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her .
I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying , " was I got ta have it ! "
I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I could nt be happier .
Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
Definitely go see them !
Bait and switch , untrained workers
Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago , before I ripped out 350 sq ft of ceramic tile ... was told I would need a " dual head concrete grinder " to remove thinset and make a nice " finished " look ( ready for concrete stain ) .
Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc .
No problem , sounded like it 's done every day .
Will look beautiful .
Got the tile ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder wo n't leave a finished look AND it 's $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts .
I can rent another machine for like $ 60 that will give it a finished look .
So from $ 55 to $ 260 ?
Are they serious ?
I feel like they did n't tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price ?
Either these people do n't know anything about what they are renting , or worse - they are bait and switching .
One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry .
Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it 's no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I 've been in .
Yes , there are bigger , but bigger is n't necessarily better .
I availed myself of the wash 'n fold service , taking just about a year 's worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I 'd originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ) .
The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future .
Did n't hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit .
Whereas my answer to the question " Where do you get your laundry done ? " used to be , " At the checkout line at WalMart , " I can honestly say the answer now is , " At The Laundry Tub . "
Thank you !
I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash .
In this day it s rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil !
I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals .
I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them !
In fact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated .
Okay , here 's the scoop .
I 'm a regular at the HH .
The food is excellent , the serivce is horrible .
I think they 're still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry .
In my experience the food has been excellent ( for the most part ) .
However , the bartenders / waitresses definately need to be re-trained ( if they ever had any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting .
In some cases the result is because of understaffing , in some cases the staff just does n't care / know better .
They must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it 's not room temperature at best when you get it home .
You just have to know what you 're getting into when you go .
Nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wings ) , and do n't go if you have a limited amount of time .
Trust The Midas Touch
I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles , I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else !
the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money .
This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them !
Like the girl with the fuse problem ...
Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed it s electrical !
maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust !
We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ( $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3.75 respectively ) .
The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ) .
The other rolls were n't at all special , especially given their pricing .
The bottom line is that the food is n't great and is relatively high - priced .
The service is solicitous , the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen TV playing football .
But I 'd go elsewhere unless the prices are cut .
It 's just not worth it .
Do n't Expect Sleep or Courtesy
I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007 .
At 3:15 am on night # 2 , the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room .
These are not household type alarms .
When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience .
I called the front desk and got no answer .
After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none , I decided to just pack up and leave .
The desk agent actually argued with me , claiming that no such alarm had gone off ( as if I would make that up ? ) .
He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ) .
This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
This hotel is adequate enough , but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management .
Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night .
Poor Service , Lack of Passion : Do NOT go
I began seeing Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk , where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office .
It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it 's a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ) .
Also , I was promised to have my test results emailed to me , but it never happened , and after a few attempts to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition , I finally gave up and went to a different doctor .
Please do not go there if it 's professional , friendly , diligent medical services you 're looking for .
Save yourself the trouble , money and time and visit a more caring facility / doctor .
The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn , but advertised all over NY / NJ , including Fort Lee .
When the guys arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for them to drive back from your destination .
That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
And another $ 100 for wrapping the furniture .
So totalling $ 212 just for start before any work started .
Guess what , was not in the initial agreement as well .
I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2 pm - 8 pm ) .
The only reason I 'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially .
One more thing , they do n't take any credit cards or checks .
You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination .
Worst Apartments EVER
We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
Then , the more power they gave to Linda , the worse the place got .
We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11:45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ) .
Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others .
Do not live here , you will regret it !
The Worst Experience Ever !!!
I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
He was referred to me by a friend , who did n't have the best experience with Ted , but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end .
I figure I would give this company a chance .
However , after giving a required $ 500.00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas , I was sorry I did .
We met a couple of weeks later , Ted was late .
He brought fabric books , and pictures of furniture only , which all came way over budget .
By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with , there was basically no design .
Just curtains and a couple of accessories .
WHAT IS THAT ?????
This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
Please everyone .... take heed and do n't get caught up in the hype about DECOR and YOU working with every budget ...
This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
Horrible .
Horrible .
When we walked in , the person behind desk said : " oh well , you must wait , I am in the middle of something . "
After a good few minutes , he asked : " what do you want ? "
Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked .
I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms .
He immediately said " no , there is a $ 50 deposit now ! "
Sure enough he charged it to the credit card .
When I inquired he rudely replied " in the morning when things are checked out you 'll get it back . "
I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
I also mentioned to the reception person .
He responded " we have problem with ' people ' " .
Imagine a hotel having problems with people .
I finally alerted him to his rudeness .
He said he 's had a long and bad day .
We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
Do n't stay there .
I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also .
My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night , catch up on our lives evening .
We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this .
My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours .
I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still would n't budge .
Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion .
I called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back .
I emailed 4 times , never a response .
In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet 's that expressed their sympathy , this hotel did nothing .
I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing .
I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews , but if something unexpected happens in your life , they will not care .
FANFUCKINGTASTIC
Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford , England .
I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC .
Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around .
I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
I knew I had found the real deal , big pies , sold by the slice , with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front .
They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano .
So I ordered a slice .
It tasted like I just flew back home .
I du n no how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it .
That being said , I do n't know how their delivery service is .
They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me .
Good food , good wait staff , poor management
We visited on 7/26/08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia 's on Greenfield Ave .
The food was good , and so was our waitress .
When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I 've gotten a gift certificate for . )
I then asked if I could have money back in cash .
The person went to go check with the manager , who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there .
Her answer was short and manner rather rude .
Sorry for interrupting I guess .
The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
I will not be visiting Mama Mia 's again .
There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more .
DINING AT TEXAS ROADHOUSE
TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS , THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES .
IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES .
ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS .
ALSO , THERE SHOULD NOT BE PEANUTS ALL OVER THE FLOOR .
NEXT , THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD .
IT S NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT .
I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW .
I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS .
WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY , THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE .
I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH , 2009 .
I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTER S BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT .
THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS , HE SAID WE CA NT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
IN MY OPINION SHOULD OF JUST TOOK OFF THE PRICE OF THE WINGS FROM THE BILL .
BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY !!!!!!
Mezza Luna FTW !
their mezza luna's are deffly better than the pizza rolls .
it s like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside .
it seems like it s healthier too , but it s prolly not .
also , you can call em ahead of time , and then go to pick up ur food , or have it delivered ** .
that cuts down on teh wait time , cus u can do other stuff while u r waiting .
it usually takes 20 mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
their pizza was a little salty for me , but it s still good .
they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it .
it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger .
** Edit : Living on campus at Clarkson University , I have had food delivered before .
This was back between '05 and '09 and I do n't remember how many times we 've had it delivered .
Perhaps they do n't deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup .
My 2004 x - type was getting close to 100,000 miles so it was time for an upgrade .
I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre-owned 2009 XF .
Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out .
I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael .
He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive .
I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade - in and the price of the 09 XF .
The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes .
Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides .
10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre-owned 09 XF .
I have purchased over 15 vehicles ( cars , rvs , and boats ) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best .
Friendly , knowledgeable , and above all fair .
That 's all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
Thanks for the great deal and the great car !
Identity Theft
Myself and my fiance 's identity was stolen from the office staff .
We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual .
Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us .
It was a black female that use to work in the office .
She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work .
The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
That s how they were caught .
They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers .
Nobody lived there .
A girl would show up , then a guy in a nice car would show up .
Short time later the guy would leave , then the leave .
My apartment was usually quiet .
I lived in one that did not face the parking lot .
Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
It sucked having an SUV .
If I found a spot , I could nt fit in it .
Gates worked 30 % of the time at best .
Bugs were a small problem , nothing too bad .
The best there is in service .
I was recently traveling down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
It was 4:50 when a friend told me to call Bud , he would take care of me .
Not only did they answer the phone at 4:50 on a Thursday , they hit the ground moving !.
They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW 330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it , then they came out , took off my tire ( it was a runflat - but runflats do n't do you any good if they blow out ) , and brought it to their shop to change the tire .
They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6:30 that evening .
Thanks Bud for all of your help and taking time away from your family that evening .
It 's without a doubt , the best service experience I 've ever had and just to be clear , the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville 's price for putting on the other rear tire .
I hope I can return the favor in the future !
Alan Grissom
Room ok .
Service and Client base not ok .
I have stayed in this hotel many times , and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck , its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood .
I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non-violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
I chose the later , but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities , not to mention the good night s sleep i paid for but did nt get .
I was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call .
I will probably stay here again because it s cheap and I ca nt afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers .
Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker .
He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying , " you do not order what you do not know about " and " you do n't know how pizza is made " .
It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home , the pie was the worst I have ever seen .
Cheese was falling off , so oily and greasy .
I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that was n't so well - done ( actually , burnt ) .
I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $ 25 .
THIS STORY IS 100 % TRUE .
That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my *ss .
Long Lines , Silly Rules , Rude Staff , Ok Food
The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot .
A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good , right ?
I mean , that 's the way it works at amusement parks : the longest lines are at the best rides .
Well , this may be an exception .
The staff taking your order and " waiting " on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all .
I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks .
And do n't even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is , and pardon my French , a jerk .
If you have gotten through ordering , dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules , you are finally presented with what you came for .. some tacos that are " ok , " but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle .
Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together .
I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac .
Wish this was in Saratoga --
We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world -- and residing in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year .
SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent .
Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food .
This chef knows what he is doing .
Treat yourself and go -- you will go back !
I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town !
The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices !
Unlike Saratoga .
I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we went -- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were .
Can not wait to go gain .
- R. Morris .
I think that the re pretty good .
First of all , if you call for an appointment they wo n't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
They also do n't tell you that they 're going to mail you an " application " to be admitted to be a patient .
I feel that the way some doctor s offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I 'm happy that these guys do n't do those two things in particlular .
Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week .
The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mother s father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that 's a common misconception ( http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm ) .
In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why .
Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
If you want miracles you 'll have to go to 21st St .
It 's a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it 's very good .
They do n't do certain things that are really annoying about other offices .
First trip to Canada
I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience .
I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation .
I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection .
Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners .
Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable .
Favorite place in Tampa .
Update : I had to add to my review .
I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room .
AMAZING !
I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their " new " dining room .
Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
We were greeted again and sat promptly .
After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had , we knew we were in for a treat !
I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner .
AMAZING !
The portions were generous enough that we even took some home !
I have to say the value of this place always amazes me .
It 's nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
Bottom line is that when it 's a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
Well Done !
Great work and honest establishment !
I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just did n't seem cost effective anymore .
I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
I had hear great things about Phet and G&G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
The service was excellent and personable .
He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work .
The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus he showed me the work he did when I came in to pick up the car .
Also , a week after the work , Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount .
That is just unheard of these days !
I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here , but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around .
He is my mechanic going forward !
Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company , thus we are certainly a niche market .
We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart , and Ulistic .
We made the decision for a couple of reasons .
1 . Social Media .
We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
How has it gone so far ?
Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
We are absolutely confident that Stuart 's ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow , and our business will reap the rewards of this program .
Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
Excellent service and quality
I had Hom - Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago .
The excellent windows have performed without any problems , but that 's not why I 'm writing my review .
Three weeks ago , burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home .
The intruders slit the screen of the window .
Next , they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer .
The window did n't break !
My next - door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light , thankfully scaring the two miscreants away ( they even left their hammer behind ! ) .
I called Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and was happily surprised when they said that they were n't even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee .
Lo and behold , they replaced the screen ( which had to be ordered ) yesterday and did n't charge me a dime .
Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me .
In this day and age , it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies .
I rarely write reviews such as this one , but they certainly deserve anyone 's business !
Friendly staff , but definitely some problems
May , 2009 .
We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1:00 am !
Next day got moved into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guests .
There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2 , no linens for sofa bed .
In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room .
They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items .
A mid-afternoon " fire drill " was disruptive , putting everyone out of the hotel .
When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
The staff was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again .
Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
My experience was awful though .
It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
Essentially , I told him I did n't trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
I do n't know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
After that , I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM , which is n't true .
I mean , I do n't care if he does n't know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there 's no way I 'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
The Worst Chinese I 've Ever Had
This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had .
The service stunk .
I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up , they got my order confused with someone else s .
They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again .
They also got my friend s order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
We were standing in the store for 20 minutes to simply pick up an order .
Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up .
We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
I do nt know how it is possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that .
The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable .
I will NEVER go here again .
Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal .
I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
Terrible Service
One of the worst experiences I 've ever had with a auto repair shop .
We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning .
Approx 4 months later , the compressor went out .
We took it back in to have it repaired again , and less than a week later the second compressor went out .
We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again , but this time when we picked up the car , the radio and clock did not work .
So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , we brought the car back again .
When we expressed our discontent to the manager ( that 's right , the manager ) , did he say he would return some money , did he say he would give a discount on our next visit , did he just say " I 'm sorry " .
Nope , none of the above .
He stood there and told us how he was n't at fault .
It was the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car .
And what did we expect ... that he bench test every part .
At no time during the conversation did the words , " I 'm sorry " ever come out of his mouth .
I , nor anyone else in my family , will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again .
Well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out .
Do not use this company !
I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced .
I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off .
They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace .
I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30.00 .
When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT !!
I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job .
I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back .
The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it .
I explained I did not get what I paid for .
She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job .
She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit .
With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS .
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY .
There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment !!!!!
I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner 's own unprofessionalism .
When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional .
Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun .
The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there .
They need to update the locker rooms ASAP .
Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away .
The owner was VERY rude , accused me of not reading my contract , and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership .
I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club 's actual OWNER ?!
Bad for business .
I was appalled .
I will never recommend this gym to any woman .
The equipment and classes are n't good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff !!!
There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500 !
The Salon Experience from Hell
I feel obligated to share this story .
Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation .
Just graduated , just moved , not rich , and starting new job soon .
I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you do n't show up , they 'll charge you .
I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick .
After he already put product on my hair he said " I should warn you , I 'm expensive . "
What was I supposed to do , say I ca n't afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair .
I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he 's so wonderful , you 're going to love your hair .
$ 400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total .
Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
I cried the entire way home .
He then " fixed " it for free but it still looked like crap .
I will never go back .
It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks .
That 's my favorite show of all time .
I 'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
Maybe he did n't do a good job and they told him so .
Absolute Nightmare !
STAY AWAY !
Very unhappy ...
Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA , so I did not know what to expect .
That said - he seemed to be doing well enough .
However , then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for .
I expected to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared .
Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
Well , that was strike one .
I was n't going to use them again , but I was going to leave it at that .
However , now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $ 6,000 + despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do , I feel I have to voice my opinion .
Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
He said yes .
Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6,000 + , all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you wo n't have to pay a penalty . '
I may not have to pay a penalty , yet , but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys .
In the words of my new accountant , THEY LET ME DOWN !
Bit sketchy , sporadic delivery times
I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place .
Why ?
Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash .
Sketchy , right ?
Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days .
( They even got me a couch pretty quickly . )
The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly , Ahmed , was nice and mostly professional , except the semi-sketchiness .
Then one day , Ahmed left the country , not to return for months , WITHOUT informing me .
He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in .
The other person working at the store did n't know that I still had this table coming .
I had paid in cash , and he said he had no receipt / record of my purchase .
I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase , and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation .
I waited .
And waited .
He never once contacted us .
I 've had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive .
He kept saying different arrival / delivery dates and did n't seem terribly apologetic .
It has been 3 weeks and I STILL do n't have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ) .
Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they 're not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you 'll have to fight to get it resolved .
Poor Service
Run do n't walk .
My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger .
If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would .
On August 21st , 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it .
After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces .
I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered .
No one will give me a date .
I spent $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor .
Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged : a piece of wood was broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand was missing a drawer .
How do you lose a drawer .
After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned .
The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture .
So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite .
I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone 's warehouse .
Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service .
Excellent Driving School
I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I 've been a nervous wreck and have n't been behind the wheel .
Unfortunately , a family emergency required me to conquer this fear .
A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
She highly recommended him and described him as the " Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions " .
I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus !
I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I did n't feel comfortable driving an SUV .
Gerry pleasantly said " since I am already here why do n't we give it shot .
I trust you and believe that you 'll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate !
Trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself .
Do n't worry , I 'll take care of you ! "
....... the rest was history !
Here I am now driving confidently on my own .
Gerry , I ca n't thank you enough for helping me cope with my fear .
To my friend , thank you for your recommendation ... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a " Saintly Instructor ... Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is !
Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food .
Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
But we do n't just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT .
Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to -- and trust me we have been to a lot of them .
We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
We stopped in and got some take out and can not stop going back .
They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted .
We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls .
And every entree we have ordered is perfect .
Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh .
Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with .
They are also quick at getting your order out to you .
You do n't have to sit and wait around forever like most places !!
So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You wo n't regret it !!
and you will go back for more !!!

PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that " all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends " and I will tell you that I do n't know these people except from eating at their restaurant .
We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago .
So that comment is completely false .
Because we think IT 'S THE BEST !!!
and we do n't know them except for eating there .
Dr. Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr. Christopher T. Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis .
I had a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ) .
He later said that by 2 months he " meant at least two months " .
Two months and at least two months are totally different things .
He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed .
He also never even said he was sorry .
Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ) , and he is letting me die .
I am just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives .
I , along with my friends , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating .
Even my PA i went to the other day said " it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you " .
He said it sarcastically .
If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
What you can learn from the below ' bad experience ' .
I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the ' bad experience ' review .
I 'd probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here , seeing that they do n't just take every dog coming in .
I 've toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was , and all the options for the dogs .
It 's unfortunate that bmil believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself .
But I 've done hundreds of dog introductions myself ( another place , I do n't work here ) , and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs .
Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it 's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
You say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him .
But not at a risk to other people 's pets .
You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .
No business is going to push customers away without good reason ; so is n't it reasonable to think they might know what they 're doing ?
My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ) .
Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this ; and maybe do n't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they do n't want to work hard , just because you bruised your own ego .
Dumbest F'ers ever
I called dominos tonight , it rang forever , I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says , MAY I HELP YOU ?
So I say : I 'm at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( built in 1926 ) do you deliver to the Warwick ?
They say no , Warwick in New Jersey , Call New Jersey .
I laugh and say , no , that Warwick is in New York , but I 'm at the Radison - Warwick .
And he says : You 're at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
and I said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and he says , NO , Warwick is a township , If you 're at a Radison in Warwick that s too far , try dominos in Pottstown .
I say , NO , I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square .
He says : I not know that town , I have to get to work , I 'm in PHILLY .
Call dominos in your town .
I SAY LISTEN : I 'm at 17th and LOCUST , do you deliver there ?
He says , I have to have an exact ADDRESS .
OK , 1701 LOCUST STREET i say .
he says : Why you tell me you r in WARWICK TOWNSHIP ?
He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
YES I am sure , well , she says , is that ON 17th STREET .
Yes , I say .
17th , like over by 16th and 15th YES , I say , one mile west of you .
You 're at 7th .
I am just south of Walnut .
She says , Is that 17th like over past broad .
YES , I am west of broad .
Broad , I say , is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut .
Hmmm , she says , Then why are you calling here , we do n't go past broad ?
Anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hung up , grabbed a cab , and went to Geno 's .
Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem !
B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June .
They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .
Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying " Workmanship is guaranteed for a year ! " .
Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in .
We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .
We heard nothing .
We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he 'd send someone out to look at it but could n't promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !
She even went so far as to say " You r calling about one board ? "
Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
YES !
I WAS calling about one board !!
I 'm very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
So I figure if they do n't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I 'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!
STAY AWAY !!!
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!
They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!
When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute price was worth it .
I called the " 207 " number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up .
I then called the 800 number ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
They had a room with a $ 99 rate , which I booked .
The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor , but they put us on the 3rd .
The email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that we are innkeepers , not longshoreman .
In other words , they do not help with suitcases , but they promise totes to help .
However upon our arrival no one there ( the inn was open ) .
So no totes .
Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3 M , no exceptions .
Then she was gone .
We returned after 3 PM , found no one there , and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room .
Rules in the room : # 1 ) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash .
If they think you 've taken a soda from your room home with you , they will charge you $ 1.50 per can .
They count the cans in the trash to make sure .
# 2 ) If you take the shampoo products home , they will charge you $ 8 per item .
# ) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour charge $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2 PM it 's a full day charge .
# 4 ) Breakfast is 8 AM to 10 AM .
No earlier and no later .
If you go later , it 's all cleaned up .
( By whom , I do n't know .
I never saw anyone there .
All these rules are posted in the rooms . )
Snacks : uninspired bread , tea backs , and individual coffee things for a machine that did n't exist .
I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee .
No wine glasses .
Room was clean , but had a weird , dated , sink / stove combo that did n't work .
Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems .
No tub .
The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads , but only one worked .
Do n't get the rooms off the two kitchens .
They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything .
Free parking .
I 'd go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $ 99 , but I would n't pay their rack rate .
Quit with the overstatements !
The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that " everyone " is going to " love " the food , decor and service .
The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
It 's an entirely up and down experience , however .
Now , the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal .
The salatim salads are the smallest plates I 've ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it were n't explained to you ) .
Though they are mostly excellent , you generally do n't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .
That being said , the laffa and hummus are out of this world .
Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ) .
Dinner was also an up - and - down experience .
The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the lamb was often dry and / or overcooked .
The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
Dessert was ... hmmm , that 's interesting , I do n't even remember dessert .
I guess that tells you a lot .
Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good .
The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination .
And my -- no , I still do n't remember what I had .
Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ) , we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you 've never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .
PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings .
When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .
Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?
MUST READ - Do not waste your time in this store .
At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses .
They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses .
I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model ( by looking the dress up online ) .
So , as I was leaving I asked for the designer / dress name or style number associated with my top picks .
They said they were " unable to tell me until they ordered my dress " .
Hmmm ... A person can not call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ) , and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
Do other brides fall for this ???
They either : a ) do n't want to give it to me because they do n't want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b ) are recreating the dresses themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress designs and " filling the orders " by their own seamstresses ) .
I 'm no detective but ... uhh ... seriously ?!?
Whatever type of operation they are running , I 'm not interested and if you 're smart , you wo n't be either .
What a waste of TIME .
Aside from that little * mystery * , one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
Somehow , since she supposedly does n't know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew " exactly which dress " I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on .
My point : Even if I was wrong , do n't sit there and argue with the customer .
Say something like , " Huh .
I did n't think so but you could be right . "
Unless you want to take the " tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she 's obviously not loving " approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere .
Seriously : do not waste your time .
Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners .
Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service .
I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I would n't trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life .
AWFUL SERVICE !
After happily visiting Sear's Automotives in the past , I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location .
I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire .
I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you do n't see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear's use ) .
Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .
Once I returned to pick up my car , you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting .
I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this was n't possible .
Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
OK , one bad experience ... fine .
The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
I would not have gone back , but I could n't find the particular tire they 'd used in stock anywhere else .
Once again , I waited for quite a bit before being attended to .
I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
Ok -- fine .
So I got just my other rear tire replaced .
They promised it 'd be done within an hour , so I waited in the lobby .
Over two hours later ( and ten minutes before they closed ) my car was finally finished .
A few minutes after I left , I was called and informed that " I " left my wheel lock ( which they should have left in the car ) .
Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
Of course I could n't make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ) .
The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
Of course , they could n't call him either to ask about it because apparently they do n't keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ) , so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ) .
On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I 'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
The employees at this Sear's are completely apathetic and there did n't seem to be any sort of management that I could see .
I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car ) .
